            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>AMongſt the many ſtrains of that unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs in men, which renders the days we live in, ſo calamitous and ſad, there is ſcarce any more deplorable or comporting with our miſery, then for men to have their mouths wide open in declaiming againſt what they are pleaſed to call Errors and Hereſies, and their ears faſt ſhut againſt all Chriſtian means and directions, either for the diſcovery and eviction of them to be ſuch, or for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of them, being ſo evicted. There is no queſtion to be made, but that there are many vile <hi>imaginations</hi> of men, <hi>which exalt themſelves againſt the knowledg of God,</hi> walking up and down amongſt us, which their fathers and friends have baptized by the names of <hi>New Lights:</hi> On the other hand, as little queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there is, but that there are many ancient Truths, alſo pleading reſtitution after a long and injurious ejectment, unto their native Honors; which becauſe they plead <hi>in form a pauperis, &amp; pauco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> are not onely denied Chriſtian audience to their Pleas, but reproached alſo with the opprobrious terms, of <hi>old accurſed Errors and Hereſies.</hi> Now when men make no ſcruple or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to binde up God and <hi>Belial,</hi> Chriſt and the Devil toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one and the ſame bundle of condemnation, becauſe they are both alike troubleſom and offenſive unto them, do they not provoke both the <hi>powers of Heaven,</hi> and the powers of Hell, at
<pb facs="tcp:150539:6"/> once againſt them? Or are ſuch men like to proſper in their days? In vain do they <hi>blow a Trumpet to prepare</hi> the Magiſtrate to <hi>battle</hi> againſt Errors and Hereſies, whileſt they leave the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Conſciences of men armed with confidence of Truth in them. If men would <hi>call</hi> more for light, and leſs <hi>for fire from Heaven,</hi> their warfare againſt ſuch enemies would be much ſooner accompliſhed. For he that denied the one, hath promiſed the other, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 2.3, 4, 5. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5.) And amongſt all Weapons, there is none like unto light to fight againſt darkneſs. But whileſt men arm themſelves againſt Satan, with the material ſword, they do but inſure his victory and triumph.</p>
            <p>They that deſire to ſerve as <hi>good ſouldiers of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> againſt Errors and Hereſies, muſt firſt conſcienciouſly ſtudy the Chriſtian Art, and Method of this Warfare; otherwiſe, they may eaſily build up what they go about to pull down, and make <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laams</hi> expedition (yet upon worſe terms) who was <hi>ſent to curſe,</hi> and yet in concluſion, <hi>bleſſed altogether, Numb.</hi> 24.10. It is hard to ſay, whether that hand which deſires to be lifted up againſt Error and Hereſie, with ſucceſs, had more need of <hi>ſoftneſs</hi> or <hi>ſtrength.</hi> Few mens Errors finde acceſs to their judgments, but by the way of their affections,
<q>
                  <l>He that will the <hi>Judgment</hi> win,</l>
                  <l>With th'<hi>Affections</hi> muſt begin.</l>
               </q> Nor will it be eaſie for men to come at them to dethrone them, but by making their approaches the ſame way; I mean, by making friends of their affections, that they may not ſide with their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt them.</p>
            <p>I have not met with any Author comparable to this now in thine hand, for a Chriſtian genius and dexterity, in teaching that deſireable and happy Art, as well of compoſing differences in matters of Judgment, as far as a compoſure in this kinde may with the honor of Truth be admitted; as of oppoſing that which is not meet to be admitted to compoſition. He intituleth his Book <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagemata Sathanae,</hi> Satans Stratagems: He might as properly with reſpect to the matter of it, have ſtiled it <hi>Stratagemata Chriſti,</hi> the Stratagems of Chriſt, inaſmuch as <hi>the wiſdom which is revealed from Heaven,</hi> for the countermining of Satan in his
<pb facs="tcp:150539:6"/> attempts upon the precious ſouls of men by errors and hereſies, is here drawn out in ſuch happy directions and inſtructions for that purpoſe, that had they their weight and worth in practiſe and due obedience, the Kingdom of Error and Hereſie would ſoon be ſhaken.</p>
            <p>If any man liſted in this warfare, being of <hi>Iehu's complexion,</hi> cannot endure to march againſt his Enemy with a ſober pace, and had rather be toſſing <hi>Firebals</hi> of <hi>Granado's,</hi> then weilding the <hi>Sword</hi> of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> this Author is like to find ſmal thanks from ſuch a perſon; ten to one but he wil<note n="*" place="margin">Ier. 8.18</note>

            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am heartily glad that ſome body hath taken the pains to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late into Engliſh <hi>Acontii Stratagemata</hi> in theſe times of <hi>ſtrife</hi> and <hi>confuſion:</hi> The Author was an <hi>excellent</hi> man, and throughly knowing in many Sciences; his <hi>excellency</hi> did lie in the <hi>depth</hi> and <hi>ſolidity</hi> of his <hi>Judgment</hi> in every thing; and in the <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Moderation</hi> of his ſpirit in Matters of Religion. At the breaking forth of the Goſpel, when he did live, many that were convicted of the errors of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered at the Truth, and the profeſſion thereof by the Reformed Churches, becauſe of the manifold diſputes and the diſorders found amongſt them, and ever ſince continued by the ſubtilty of Satan, who not being able to hinder the breaking in of more light, doth endevor to make it either ineffectual or hurtful to the ſalvation of mens ſouls. As it was then, ſo it is now, at every <hi>Period</hi> of our <hi>Reformation;</hi> he doth make every Truth a Matter of Strife; and what he cannot ſuppreſs by the power of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, he endevors to pervert by the evil uſe that men make of knowledg, to diſappoint them of the end for which God hath given it. This wiſe man in his time did diſcover <hi>Satans</hi> aym, and warned his Generation faithfully, and chiefly the <hi>Watchmen,</hi> of the grand adverſaries deſign againſt them: But how much this Admonition is laid to heart, doth appear by the Diſtempers of all
<pb facs="tcp:150539:9"/> places, whereof both the Cauſes and Remedies are here diſcovered and offered to the Churches, but minded almoſt by none. However ſome there are, at all times, &amp; wil be, who wil be affected herewith; and God is able by their means to qualifie the ſpirits of others, and to caſt Satan under the feet of his Elect and Faithful ſervants, in his own time. Therefore it is very uſeful that ſuch Teſtimonies as theſe ſhould be extant; and now to us, they are very ſeaſonable, although perhaps in haſte we ſhal ſee no great fruit thereof. But our comfort is, that although <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven is as a grain of muſtard ſeed,</hi> yet it groweth at laſt to be a <hi>mighty great tree,</hi> ſo that <hi>the fowls of heaven lodg in the branches there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi> Therefore we muſt not be we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.9.</note> that in due time we ſhal reap, if we faint not. To be carried along with the ſtream, or to be ſilent when matters are not carried according to our mind, is no hard matter to any that hath any meaſure of diſcretion; but to row againſt the ſtream, to labor againſt wind and tyde, and the whole current of an age, and that without offence unto any, and that ſtrongly and irreſiſtibly (as in his Age <hi>Acontius</hi> did) is not the work of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Courage; therefore ſuch as own him in his way are the more to be commended. I ſhal therefore intreat you to remember my love and ſervice to your friend who hath taken this profitable pains to tranſlate this <hi>excellent piece of Learning,</hi> and thank him from me for it. I make no doubt but it wil be convincing ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to ſuch as are free from <hi>hardneſs of Heart</hi> in the ways of factiouſneſs; and are not blinded with <hi>carnal ends,</hi> in the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Religious Controverſies.</p>

            <p>IF any man ſhall haply wonder at the raſhneſs or fool-hardineſs of him, who hath hoped to accompliſh ſo endleſs a work, as to collect and commit to writing the Sratagems of <hi>Satan,</hi> which is all one, as if he would undertake to draw the Ocean dry. I would have that man conſider with himſelf a little, whether or no, by how much the Arts of this cunning old cheater, are more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, various and myſterious; we ought not to take the greater heed to ſave our ſelves from him? This I ſuppoſe he will confeſs: But how ſhall we take heed, if thoſe Arts of <hi>Satan</hi> be unknown? Might we not juſtly fear, that there might be moſt danger, where we leaſt ſuſpected any? That where we did think to eſcape, there we ſhould fall into ſome hidden ſnare? Which is too often ſeen in many perſons, and they none of the ſimpler ſort, but even the moſt eminent in the Church of God. Since then it lies us in hand to look to our ſelves, which we cannot do without this knowledg, we are neceſſitated to try, if by any means we may attain the ſame; and to beg of God (to whom every thing is eaſie) to be our aſſiſtant herein. Whoſe help having frequently implored, we hope we have not loſt our labour, but that all good men ſhall bleſs God with us, for putting this thought into our mind, and graciouſly proſpering our endeavours. One thing there is, which of a long time, hath much afflicted my Spirit: for every man is ſenſible, how much the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Churches depends upon thoſe that are of eminent au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ſo that if they ſtand, all things cannot but go well; if they fall, every man almost wil be overwhelmed in their ruin: Whence it is, that <hi>Satan</hi> aimes chiefly, and almoſt ſolely at them, leaving nothing unattempted which may defile, marr and corrupt them. And in caſe he do not always looſe his labour, but ſometimes gains the victory over them; thoſe Stratag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ms, whereby he doth it, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be laid open, but the failings of the vanquiſhed muſt likewiſe be diſcovered, which diſcovery, how hatefull
<pb facs="tcp:150539:10"/> a thing it is any man may eaſily conceive: For as any reprehenſion is ever displeaſing to the nature of man: ſo is it then espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially distasteful, when it is unuſual and beſide expectation. Now what is there can be done more unwonted and leſs expected, then for a man to reprehend thoſe whom all good men do admire and very much reverence; to whom it ſeems to appertain to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe Laws to others, rather then to have Laws ſet to them: to teach all men rather then to learn of any one? Yea, but (you wil ſay) ſuch men wil be ſo far from taking any offence, that if you ſhal ſhew them any failings, out of their humanity and prudence they wil give you many thanks; indeed that is my hope. Yet is it a matter of greater moment then men are lightly aware of, to incur the il-wil of perſons of ſuch authority and reputation. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, I am much more troubled to conſider the over eager inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſome men, who account ſuch as they have once begun to admire, to be no longer men but gods, againſt whom, if a man ſpeak but a word, he is looked upon as if he blasphemed God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. What ſhould I do in this caſe? Should I, to avoyd ill will, forbear to diſcover ſuch ſnares, as Satan ſets to catch men in, not only to their own, but the whole Church of God's ruine? What were this leſs in me, then to hold confederacy with Satan, and to conspire their destruction? I have ſhewed all the favor I could, which was, to uſe as much gentleneſs as I could poſſible: I have ſpared mens names, and mentioned only the things themſelves, wherein I perceived the ſnares of Satan to lie hid. Now, if ſo be any man ſhal interpret himſelf injured, by the reprehenſion of ſuch things wherein he may be ſome ways concerned, let him but think with himſelf how juſtly and honeſtly he ſhal make any ſuch interpretation: Verily, he may with as much reaſon, juſtifie the complaints of Drunkards, Adulterers, Homicides, and all other flagitious perſons, againſt thoſe whoſe duty it is to inveigh againſt the bad manners and wickedneſſes of men; then which what could be more abſurd? But (thou maiſt ſay) what if thoſe things thou ſpeakeſt againſt, deſerved not ſuch a reproof? Surely, if any ſuch thing be, when I ſhal know as much, I ſhal be very ſorry for my overſight. For I am no ſuch man as to think that I cannot err. Sure I am, it hath been none of mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, either openly or cloſely, to provoke or offend any man. I take
<pb facs="tcp:150539:10"/> him to witneſs that knoweth all things: ſo that who ever he be, that hath any the least drop of Chriſtian clemency, ought eaſily be moved to pardon me in ſuch a caſe. Howbeit, juſt it is, that he that ſhal be touched by the things we handle, do not make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf judg, but refer the matter to the judgment of ſuch, who are herein, in reſpect of their own particular, nothing concerned. And far better it is for us, amongst our ſelves, to note the ſlips one of another, and lovingly to labor for an amendment, then to wait til our Enemies ſhal thereby take occaſion to rail againſt us and our profeſſion with a venomous tongue. Yet wil the Papiſts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whoſe hands this diſcourſe ſhal come, laugh to ſee our wounds laid open. But, it is better they ſhould laugh at our wounds, whiles in the mean time they are curable, then that we ſhould ſuffer them, for want of medicines, to exulcerate and become incurable, and ſo make them laugh at our deſtruction. I would only ſay thus much to them, that when they have ſufficiently lamented their own maladies, I wil give them free leave to recreate themſelves with laughing at ours. Let them turn over the ancient hiſtories, and ſee if the Church of God were ever in ſo good an eſtate, but that there were therein many things which might deſerve the grief of every good man; and finding the condition of the Church to have been always ſuch, what cauſe is there for them to wonder, if we are not in every part ſound. But let them laugh that liſt. Our endeavor ſhould be, by removing all juſt cauſe of reprehenſion, not ſo much to ſuppreſs their laughter, as by all excellency of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to invite them, together with us, to come unto Chriſt. And that thou maiſt not fear any ſharpneſs of language in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, know, that we endeavor no other thing ſo much, in all this work of ours, as to reduce all thoſe which handle any points in the Church, whether by word or writing, to the greateſt mildeneſs and gentleneſs that may be. How unſeemly therefore, and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt a thing would it have been, if I had refuſed to be ſubject to that Law which I had ſet to others? How juſtly might that proverb be laid in my diſh, <hi>Phyſician heal thy ſelf?</hi> But to come to the paine: In this Treatiſe <hi>(Reader)</hi> we preſent thee with thoſe Stratagems whereby Satan lies in wait to overthrow the Kingdom of Christ, and in ſuch ſort, to root it up, as it were, out of the world, that it might never be again repaired; and to ſet up
<pb facs="tcp:150539:11"/> a Kingdom of his own and to maintain the ſame, if not all of them (for that were an impoſſible thing) yet I am perſwaded the moſt principal. And, that thou maiſt wonder (ſhal I ſay, or rejoyce) the more thou ſhalt find them marſhalled in ſuch order and method; that thou ſhalt find them to make a certain kind of Art. We have added cautions for the avoyding of them, and they are ſuch as (if I am not miſtaken) whoſoever ſhal not ſlight them, may have good ground to hope, that though Satan plot never ſo much, yet he ſhal but loſe his labor. In ſome caſes peradventure, when the caution ſeemed manifeſt enough of it ſelf by the rule of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, we have forborn to put our ſelves to unneceſſary labor. Some things indeed there are which for want of examples may ſeem ſomewhat obſcure: which exam les were therefore omitted, becauſe, ſuch as we found ready to our hand, could not (as we conceived) be alledged without the offence of ſome men. Which thing (leſt our labor might be fruitleſs to them ward) we were carefully to ſhun; in ſome caſes we could not conveniently feign examples; in others, though we might have done it, yet we fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, leſt they might occaſion new contentions; which I wiſh we have not too much occaſioned, notwithſtanding all our care to the contrary. But if thou ſhalt read the Diſcourſe frequently and attentively, there wil be nothing, which thou ſhalt not at length underſtand, even without examples. Some wil wiſh that this Argument had been handled more largely, and that not without juſt cauſe; to ſuch, all that I ſhal anſwer is this, that I have done what the time would permit me; if I would have deferred the impreſſion, the work might have appeared to the world, at leaſt more poliſhed and exact; but foraſmuch as I conceived that it greatly concerned the common good of all Chriſtians, that theſe Stratagems ſhould ſee the light with all poſſible ſpeed, I was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather to ſet at nought mine own reputation, then to defer the Edition the leaſt moment. If the Lord ſhal afford me any leaſure, I ſhal endeavor that they may hereafter come forth more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and better adorned: In the mean time (gentle Reader) take in good part this abortive birth, and joyn thy godly prayers to mine, that the Lord would be pleaſed to furniſh me with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what beter and more profitable, then what, for the preſent, I am able to preſent.</p>

               <head>The Argument.</head>
               <p>THe end <hi>Satan</hi> aimes at in all his Stratagems. The Nature of Man ſince the fall, how fit for <hi>Satan</hi> to work upon. The ways and means <hi>Satan</hi> uſes to attain his end. How true opinions concerning religion come to be changed into falſe. Deceitful and invalid Arguments, Paſſions and Affections of the mind, A good opinion of thoſe that are erronious, An evil opinion of thoſe that hold the truth, lying ſigns and wonders what force they have to change mens Judgments from truth to Error. <hi>Satans</hi> devices to make diſputes and debates, intended for the clearing of truth, to ſerve his own ends in the advancement of Error. Many prime perſons, Pillars of the Church, whiles they Zealouſly as they think maintain the cauſe of Chriſt, do drive on and advance <hi>Satans</hi> deſigns. A paſſionate indiſcreet oppoſition, a great encreaſer of Sects. No unneceſſary Controverſy ought to be raiſed. An opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ought not to be condemned for appearing new, but muſt be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the word. A very hard thing to embrace Truth when it hath the appearance of an Error. To reject what ever ſavours of Novelty, wil cauſe, that remaining errors ſhal never be purged out of the Church. How erronious perſons are to be prepared to receive a ſight of their errors. What caution is to be uſed that we oppoſe not truth under the name of error. What ought to be accounted knowledg, what opinion. What Man is moſt like to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:150539:12"/> find the Truth. Moſt men ſuppoſe they are led by the word and ſpirit to think as they do in matters of Religion, whiles their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are biaſed by Antiquity, eſtimation of mens learning, Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of thoſe that judg ſo or ſo &amp;c. He that would have his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſwayed by Gods ſpirit, muſt pray earneſtly for the ſpirit, and caſt out of his conſideration whatſoever is not of God nor his word, as if there were no ſuch thing in the world. He that hath attained to a clear and perfect knowledg, cannot ſuſpect himſelf of error in that point. Before a man oppoſe a tenet as erronious and impious, he ought ſeriouſly to conſider, what aſſurance he hath of the error and impiety of the ſaid point. A man may pray long for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Truth before the wiſedom of God may think fit to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſame unto him. God is free to diſcover the truth to a man when and by whom he pleaſes, yea by him whom he oppoſes as a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer. In controverſies of religion <hi>Sathan</hi> can play the part both of opponent and defendant in reſpect of one and the ſame tenet. We muſt firſt hear and examine a point before we condemn it, and never ſay it is an old Error and hath bin oft confuted, for it may have bin an old truth ill defended. Controverſies ſoon raiſed, hardly laid. Before we oppoſe an error we muſt conſider of what moment it is. Vain queſtions and tenets not to be confuted, but avoided. <hi>Satan</hi> labours to perſwade a man, that every opinion he takes up, is a moſt ſerious and weighty point, without the knowledg wherof there can be no ſalvation. Rules to diſtinguiſh curious unprofitable queſtions that are to be avoided, from ſober, ſerious, and profitable ones that ought to be handled. The End of all Chriſtian Doctrine. What ever is profitable to that end is uſeful to be known. An enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of uſeful Doctrines. A Doctrine that reaches no further then ſpeculation, is vaine. Every Doctrine that any ways makes for the attainment of the aforeſaid end, is not of ſuch moment, as that a controverſie ſhould be raiſed therabout, foraſmuch as ſome other Doctrines unqueſtioned may perform the ſame ſervice. Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the Perſons diſſenting makes a point in controverſie ſeem far weightier then in truth it is, which may be ſeen in the eager bic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kering of the Ancient Chriſtians about <hi>Eaſter</hi> day and other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſmal moment. The right way to bring men from vain and unprofitable queſtions. What Miniſters, Profeſſors in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, Writers of books ought to do to that end. To ſtand long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:150539:12"/> and to affect to make many Sermons upon one text, a great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſtarting curious and unprofitable queſtions. Large Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries guilty in the like kind.</p>

               </gap>e into ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what the end is at which all his conſultations aime, which is not Very hard to tel. For, ſeeing that he is defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Scripture A MAN-SLAYER from the very BEGINNING, what can we think he ſhould rather aime at then the DEATH of <hi>MAN</hi> and that <hi>ETER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAL.</hi> Being therefore as the oldeſt ſo the craftieſt fox in the world, wee may aſſure our ſelves that nothing can eſcape his indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours which may prove pernitious to mankind to be put upon; and as certain it is that he endeavours to divert them from, whatſoever may prove conducible to their Salvation. Now the Salvation of Man conſiſts in obeying God, as his death and miſery in diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>Wouldſt thou obtain life</hi> (ſaid our Lord) <hi>keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments</hi> (by Commandements or Law in this place we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, whatſoever we are commanded not only to do or not to do, but to beleive) whence it follows that the <hi>MAN-KILLERS</hi> grand deſign is to keep us from obeying the commands of God. Now the Commands of God may be violated as ſoon by thoſe that know them not as by thoſe that know them, for though he be much the greater delinquent who diſobeys that command of God known, then he that through ignorance tranſgreſſeth; yet ſhal not ignorance make any one guiltleſs, for it is almoſt impoſſible that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one ſhould be ignorant without his own fault. Howſoever, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, the ignorance of Gods Law and the violation thereof are ſo nearly allyed, that the one is mutually the others cauſe. By not knowing the mind of God, thou doeſt that which moves his anger oft times when thou thinkeſt highly to pleaſe him, for which cauſe amongſt the reſt, thou art deprived of all light of ſound judgment,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:150539:13"/> and dayly overwhelmed with more groſs and palpable darkneſs. If thou knoweſt his law and doeſt not obey it, it wil by the juſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God come to paſs, that thou ſhalt fall from the knowledg thereof and ſlip into ſome great errors.</p>
            <p>This then being the end of all <hi>Sathans</hi> Counſels, foraſmuch as it is MAN-KIND he labours to undoe, that we way more eaſily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his deceits, let us diligently conſider the nature of <hi>MAN.</hi> Though <hi>MAN</hi> at the firſt was created of a good, right and every ways perfect Nature and diſpoſition, yet breaking the command of God, he became of another NATURE quite contrary, exceedingly corrupt and lyable to all manner of vice. Hence it is, that (1) he loves himſelf immeaſurably, but with a kind of blind and intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate affection, wherewith being led, he loaths his true good, and ſeeks his own hurt and dammage. (2) As our firſt Parents credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Serpent</hi> when he ſaid, as ſoon as ye ſhal taſte the fruit ye ſhal be as it were Gods knowing good and evil; ſo hath there ever ſince ſtuck ſuch a perſwaſion in Mankind, that every man takes himſelf to be a kind of Diety. which diſpoſition upon the leaſt occaſion, preſently diſcovers it ſelf. For as ſoon as he is a little advanced in dignity, or hath but ſcraped together ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable heap of Earth, he judges every body bound to give him all the reſpect that may be, yea to ſeek his commodity with their own loſs. If he get a little Learning, preſently he imagins <hi>he</hi> knows all things, and <hi>he</hi> alone; ſo that the whole world ought to be governed by <hi>his</hi> wiſedom, leaving nothing undone which may beget ſuch an opinion of him, not knowing or little caring how unjuſt he is in ſo doing. (3) He is wonderfully addicted to bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſures and exceeding intemperate in the uſe of ſuch things as are thereunto conducing. (4) He loves this life and thereabout ſpends all his thoughts, not ſo much as thinking of the life to come. He dreams this life wil laſt for ever, and though he ſee daily milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men fall before his eyes, he cannot be brought ſeriouſly to be perſwaded, that himſelf came into the world upon like terms of mortality. (5) And ſince he ſees that riches wil furniſh him with what ever he deſires, and while they do ſo they muſt needs waſt, and that an infinite quantity is requiſite towards the expence of an endleſs life, hence it is that he hath an inſatiable deſire to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wealth. Some ſuch conceit it was together with a ſtrange
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:150539:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> weakneſs of mind, that made the Soveraignty of the whole world ſeem too too little for <hi>Alexander</hi> the great. (6) In reference to the knowledg of God and his wil, of his own proper good and evill which conſiſts wholy in the favour or offence of God, he is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blind, thinking himſelf in the mean time as quick-ſighted as an <hi>Eagle.</hi> To give aſſent unto truths of this nature, and to reject the contrary errors is as repugnant to his diſpoſition, as it is for heavy things to fall Heaven-ward. Not that he hates truth as truth, or is delighted with lies as lies, but becauſe of the corruption of his Judgment in things of this nature taking truth for falſhood, and falſhood for truth it ſelf. (7) And look how he himſelf is diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, though he perceive it not, ſo he imagins the bleſſed God to be, worſhipping him accordingly with Gold, Silver, Precious ſtones and Jewels; with great, coſtly and magnificent buildings; yea and ſometimes with ſuch things, as ſhould one man honour another with, it would be interpreted a great reproach and mockery. He wil needs have him to be a viſible God, and therefore paints him and ſhapes him out according to his own fancy. He cannot in good earneſt perſwade himſelf that God knows, cares for, or moderates the affairs of mankind, that he wil give rewards or inflict puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: whence it is, that neither by pious affection to God, nor through fear or puniſhment, can he be drawn to forbear ſuch pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, as are declared offenſive to him. (8) Each mans ſight failes him when he ſhould ſee theſe faults in himſelf, but he needs no ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles to ſpie them in another. Other mens doings he is apt to miſconſtrue, being exceeding ſuſpitious; yet if a man once begin to think highly of, and attribute much to another man (eſpecially in matters of religion) therein he wil over-ſhoot all bounds of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and make that man a kind of a God. Other ways he wiſhes wel to none but himſelf, and would have no body elſe excel in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Whereupon if any profit or praiſe accrue to another, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes envious and hinders what he can the increaſe thereof. He diminiſhes the praiſes and augments the failings of another, uſing calumniation. (9) If in any matter he be never ſo little oppoſed he is exceeding prone to wrath and hatred, neither can he eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his ſtomach, but rather whets himſelf more and more to blood, ſlaughter and all kinds of cruel revenge. Thus is man of his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture above meaſure arrogant, high-conceited, intemperate, coveteous,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:150539:14"/> unſatiable, deſirous of what is another mans, a ſupplanter, lyer, contentious, envious, revengeful, murderous, blind, raſh, obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, ungodly, and born to all miſcheif. In a word, the nature of man; ſuch as now it is, is not much unlike the Nature of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Spirits. True it is, notwithſtanding, that ſuch vices as we have or might have named, do not all alike appear in all men, but ſome ſhew themſelves more in ſome men then in others, and ſome are not at all ſeen in ſome men, by reaſon they want means or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to practiſe them. Conſtitution of body, education, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, ſtudy, and ſuch like are of great moment, both to render a man prone unto, and to withdraw him from vices, yet is there not any man in whom the ſeeds of all vices are not found. Howbeit there are yet remaining in man ſome foot-ſteps and prints of his firſt nature, as a kind of obſcure knowledg of what is juſt and unjuſt, honeſt and diſhoneſt, that good deeds deſerve praiſe, and ill deeds puniſhment. He ſeems to have a natural deſire of knowledg and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. He has in him a certain kind of ability, from things, perceived by the ſenſe to arrive to the knowledg of inſenſible things and ſo to raiſe himſelf to a certain kind of knowledg of the divine Nature it ſelf. He hath ſome ſuſpition that there ſhal be a life after this, which ſhal ever laſt, attended with happines to the good, with miſery and torments to the wicked. This is manifeſt by the Poets fables, whoſe diſcourſes being accommodated to the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the People, make frequent mention of ſuch things. With this ſlight opinion of another life goes hand in hand ſome little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Salvation, wherewith provoked he enquires after the means of worſhipping and procuring the favour of God. But the truth is, theſe remainders of mans priſtine goodneſs, are kept under by ſo great and manifold oppoſitions of depraved nature, that in moſt men they wholy vaniſh and come to nought, and though in ſome they ſtrongly reſiſt the corruption of nature, as may be ſeen in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, Seneca</hi> and others, yet in their ſtrength never ſo great, as without the aſſiſtance of God to be of any moment to procure Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Rather by the event it appears, Man is thereby led into greater darkneſs. Now this is that which vexes <hi>Sathan,</hi> that God of his infinite goodneſs bearing an extraordinary affection to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, chuſes himſelf out of Mankind ſervants, ever and anon, on whom he beſtows the knowledg of his Law, and whom he ſends
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:150539:14" rendition="simple:additions"/> to inſtruct the Nations of the world.</p>
            <p>Mans Nature, then being ſuch as we have ſhewn, and the End of all <hi>Sathans</hi> conſultations diſcovered, the next thing we have to conſider, is by what way he ſeeks to attain unto this end. Two conditions there are, in the one of which the people are always found, in the Light of truth, or in the Dark of errors and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Neither is there ever ſo much light, but that ſome miſts of ignorance remain (which we thought neceſſary to give warning of, leaſt in ſpeaking of that lightful condition of men, and making mention of error, we might be thought to handle things out of their place) Now when the people enjoy the Light of Truth, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> endeavours to overwhelm them with darkneſs; if they be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the darkneſs of Error, his ſcope is that that darkneſs may for ever remain. Now a man may walk in the darkneſs of ignorance, either exerciſing no Religion, or a corrupt and falſe one. Again, a man may be without Religion, either having never heard of ſuch a thing as we call Religion, and never having once thought of ſuch a thing; or underſtanding the notion, but denying that there is any ſuch matter, as do thoſe monſters of men, who either deny that there is a God, or that he cares for the affairs of Mankind, Yet that there ſhould be any Nation ſo bruitiſh, as not to think of God, ſeems incredible; but that there is never wanting a parcel of deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate fellows, that perſwade themſelves it is a vain and ſilly thing to think of God, is more manifeſt then to need any proof, theſe are the Divels drudges he makes uſe of for the accompliſhment of any, the moſt abominable wickedneſſes.</p>
            <p>After that the true Religion hath been extant in a Nation, to the end that Nation fall therefrom into Errors, it is neceſſary their judgments alter. Now this change is either obſerved by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or not obſerved. If they obſerve it, there muſt needs be ſome cauſe, why they ſhould leave that Doctrine they had approved, to embrace ſome other falſe and impious. Now the cauſes that true opinions in matter of Religion are changed for falſe, are falſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, paſſions and affections of mind, ſuch as are <hi>deſire, wrath, hatred;</hi> a good opinion of ſuch as err, a bad opinion of ſuch as teach the truth, and lying ſigns or wonders. Falſe arguments we account ſuch, from which untruth is any way inferred, which may come to paſs divers ways. For either all that is alledged is falſe,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:150539:15"/> as in this inference: the Maſs ought to be retained, becauſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath uſed it ever ſince the times of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and what ever hath bin of ancient uſe in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ought to be retained: or that which is alledged is in part true, and partly falſe: as in this inference, becauſe the Apoſtles ordinances are to be practiſed [which is true] and confeſſion of a mans ſins in the ears of a Preiſt is an ordinance of the Apoſtles inſtitution [which is falſe] therefore this cuſtom of confeſſing ſinns in the Prieſts eare, ought to be retained. Again, all that is brought for proof may be true, and yet nothing to the purpoſe; as if a man ſhould ſay, we are bound to obſerve difference of meats according to the preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe fiſhes, herbs, Roots, and the like do nouriſh leſs then fleſh and eggs. Or laſtly, the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be ſuch, as may ſeem to prove much, when indeed they prove juſt nothing, ſuch as the Arguments of Sophiſters uſe to be. As if a man ſhould thus reaſon, No Chriſtian man ought to marry a Chriſtian woman, becauſe every Chriſtian woman is his ſiſter, and for a man to marry his ſiſter, is utterly unlawful. Now the motions of mens minds, which give occaſion to change true o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions into falſe are divers; whereof ſome are referred to the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of truth, ſome to the teachers of error, and the reſt to the Doctrine it ſelf, whether true or falſe. The doctrine of truth is apt to be hated, becauſe it accuſes a man, forbids him ſuch things as he is delighted with, and commands ſuch things as he muſt do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his wil. Now that doctrine which a man hates he wil eaſily forſake. Contrarily, men are apt to love falſe doctrine, becauſe it gives reyns to their ſinful pleaſures. It begets an ill opinion of the profeſſors of the truth, when they appear to give little credit to what themſelves teach, which comes to paſs, when their life oppoſes their Doctrine, and they ſeem to be acted rather by their own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity and falſe intereſts, then any love to Religion it ſelf. Likewiſe the teachers of truth looſe their credit, when God ſeems not to like of their doctrine by loading them with calamities and afflictions, but this is only with ſuch as eſtimate things rather by their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural judgment, then the rule of Gods Word. The Contrary to theſe, beget a good opinion of erronious teachers. As for falſe ſigns they are ſuch as are either reported falſly, or being the contrivances and jugglings of men or divels, are thought to be wrought by God himſelf.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:150539:15"/>
            <p>Furthermore ſuch conſiderations as make men alter their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, muſt either come into mens minds of their own accord, or there muſt be ſome few ſeducers which propound them to the reſt, as it uſually falls out; otherwiſe impoſſible it is any notable change ſhould happen. Now ſeducers do either teach openly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the doctrine received, or privately; with, or without any oppoſition. But that any ſhould be able publiquely to contradict the doctrine received, without any reſiſtance, it is requiſite that there be no difference of wits among the people, which is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And if ſo be that thoſe which oppoſe ſuch a teacher prove more potent then the favourers, they wilbe an hinderance to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer. Neither is it to be doubted, but that, when as the true worſhip of God is amongſt a People, if any one ſhal ſpread falſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, there wil be more oppoſers then favourers; unleſs haply the whole multitude be very ill-affected, and the ſeducer uſe much cunning to that effect, as if he ſhal firſt gain a great opinion of his own wiſedom or holineſs, or ſhal abuſe the Authority of ſuch as are ſo accounted of, which was the practiſe of thoſe of old, who brought unto the Churches letters pretended to be ſent by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, or thruſt upon them other writings with lying titles, and by ſuch impoſtures ſeduced the ſimple. Of this ſort was the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> the Travels of S. <hi>Peter</hi> and the like. Nor were whole books alone fathered upon thoſe that had no hand in them, but many were occaſioned to complain, that their own proper writings were depraved. So among the writings of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and many famous men beſides, many baſtard tracts are foiſted in, and many places of their own works are corrupted. Yea ſuch was the impudence of ſome, that even whilſt the Authors were living, they inſerted into their works, ſuch tenents as themſelves would have to be beleived, which was <hi>Origens</hi> Lot, as himſelf complains. Otherwiſe, it appears not how errors can be ſpread abroad at firſt, ſave among a few, and that privately. And though ſome ſeducer may privily turn away a few from the Doctrine received, yet can he not ſo do by many without being diſcovered; whence it comes to paſs that a ſenſible mutation cannot be made without Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies. Now they that oppoſe a ſeducer, do it either by Reaſon or by Authority; by Reaſon, when a man by word of mouth or writing, maintains the doctrine received, and reſiſts the new,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:150539:16"/> uſing to that end either arguments or teſtimonies; by Authority, when thoſe that are the overſeers of the Churches, or the Churches themſelves, do by common vote condemn that ſame new doctrine as impious and repugnant to the word of God, and when the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate ſhal under penalty forbid the ſame to be taught or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <p>Now look as if ſeducers be in a right way reſiſted, all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of <hi>Sathan</hi> are fruſtrate; ſo moſt like it is that hereabout <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> imploies all his crafts, and makes uſe of his utmoſt ſubtilty, to cauſe, that whatſoever ſhal be done by way of oppoſition, ſhal not only not hinder his deſigns, but help forward and promote them exceedingly. Wherefore it wil be labour wel beſtowed, to underſtand by what ſtratagems he endeavours to bring this to paſs. Firſt, therefore in regard of Reaſon which uſes to be oppoſed to ſeducers, by way of diſputation, either face to face, or by writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; certain it is, that ſuch reaſoning is then of force to reſiſt the falſe doctrine, when it doth aptly lay open both the weakneſs of thoſe foundations upon which it is built, and the ſtrength of the grounds which uphold the Doctrine received: as alſo when thoſe who are dealt with, ſhal with a quiet mind and uncorrupted judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment diligently weigh the ſame. Unleſs, therefore the Reaſons be ſuch as we have ſaid, and the ſpeech of the Arguers ſhal have power to reduce the adverſaries to that ſame tranquillity of mind, and ſoundneſs (that I may ſo ſpeak) of judgment aforeſaid; if it be ſuch as ſhal rather work the contrary effects; ſo far ſhal ſuch reaſoning prove from reſiſting, that it wil in a wonderful manner favour the deſigns of <hi>Sathan.</hi> Now to weigh and meaſure out, what kind of reaſoning is ſuitable to the adverſaries genius and judgment, and what not, no man is able, unleſs he himſelf have his mind compoſed and ſerene, remembring withal, that he is bound and that withal diligence to make ſuch enquiry. Since therefore it is requiſite to this purpoſe that the opponent be calm and compoſed in his ſpirit, we muſt not omit to ſhew what things they be that uſe to trouble the mind of ſuch an one. And for the moſt part, he wil be in a paſſion, if it ſtand with his private inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, that there be no change made in the doctrine received, which is true concerning all that execute the office of Teachers. For a change of Doctrine cannot be effected, but their dignity and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:150539:16"/> muſt ſuffer an eclipſe, as though they had taught falſities, yea and their profit wil be much impaired. Again his love to his own doctrine wil make him ſcarce of ability patiently to endure a contradictor; and look how likeneſs of manners, ſtudies, opinions prevail much to beget love, ſo all diſſimilitude is apt to procure hatred. To all which if reproaches and accuſations from the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary ſhal be added, of neceſſity the minds of the opponents wil be moved much more.</p>
            <p>Neither ſhalt thou be ever able to any purpoſe to weaken a falſe aſſertion, unleſs thou firſt underſtand what it is; now he that does not with attention and patience liſten, that does not ſuſpend his judgment til the defendant have finiſhed his diſcourſe, cannot ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently underſtand what it is which he affirms, but whiles at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very word ſpoke, he wil be divining at the others meaning, and ſuffers his judgment to out-run his adverſaries words, he ſhal not confute his arguments, but thoſe which by his own raſhneſs and falſe interpretation he hath feigned to himſelf. And theſe miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages then fall out when we hate our adverſary, and when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn him eſpecially. Now the principal and almoſt only cauſe of contempt is when we take too much delight in our own abilities, and arrogate unto our ſelves, a greater ſhare of ſcience or judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then is fit. And if there be any vice unto which a man is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally inclined, it is arrogance, which gathers ſtrength and growth by divers means. As firſt, if many men have a very great opinion of any one, and few there be that think otherwiſe of him, and they of very mean account. Of kin hereunto is, when a man conceits himſelf to have given ſome great and certain proof of his own wiſdom and judgment, which thing befalls them who always or very often have appeared conquerers in diſputation, and who frequently ſpeaking in publique before the people, ſeldom or never meet with any that do contradict them; for unleſs ſuch men watch themſelves with a great deal of prudence, it can hardly come to paſs but that they wil think themſelves to be the only wiſe men, and ſlight, and ſet at nought all others in compariſon. That Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb is ſufficiently known, <hi>Obſequium amicos, veritas odium pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>it,</hi> Flattery gains freinds, Truth makes foes: whence it comes to paſs that thoſe whoſe condition is ſuch, that they ſeem able to do a man good or hurt, to procure his commodity or hinderance,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:150539:17"/> his honor or diſgrace, ſcarce any body wil contradict ſuch men, rather multitudes wil flatter them. Neither would I have thee think (reader) that it is neceſſary that thou become the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> that thou maiſt be flattered. For in as much as now a days not very many ſtudy Religion, ſaving ſuch as have reſolved to become Church-men, more mindful of their belly for the moſt part then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing elſe; thoſe men by whoſe vote or recommendation, Church-imployments are obtained (<hi>viz.</hi> the Miniſters of every Pariſh of moſt note) though otherwiſe they are of no great wealth, yet ſhal you ſee them no leſs clawed and flattered by moſt men, then if they were to deal with that Idol of <hi>Rome,</hi> gaping after the fatteſt Benefices. What think you they would do, if ſome great revenues were joyned with the power, ſuch men have to preferre to livings or places in the Church. Neither is it a light matter, that (as now the caſe ſtands in many places) every mans life and reputation, lies open to the laſh of thoſe they call Preachers; ſo that if a man diſpleaſe them, and ſo come under their cenſure, he ſhal quite loſe his credit: whence it is that every man had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have them his friends then his Enemies, and ſcarce ſhal you find any one that wil oppoſe them, unleſs by ſome very urgent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion thereunto induced. To all which occaſions, if any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable learning be concurring, which of it ſelf alone, as <hi>Paul</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies, though not by its own fault (for it is a great gift of God) but through the corruptneſs of mans nature, is wont to puff a man up; without doubt Arrogance and Inſolence wil be very much augmented. Whereupon, if ſuch a man as one of theſe, ſhal be ſet to oppoſe a ſeducer, unleſs he warily conſider with himſelf, what operations, Authority, Learning, Wealth (if he be rich) and reputation uſe to have, it wil be little leſs then a miracle, if he behave not himſelf inſolently and arrogantly, charging his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary with what ever ſhal come to his tongues end, and yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly taken with his own diſcourſe, ſo that he alone muſt ſpeak, oft times triumphing before he hath gotten the victory, whence it may fall out that a good cauſe having got a bad champion, ſhal loſe ſomewhat of its reputation. Yea and we find by experience, that when a man is certainly perſwaded of a thing, and hath reaſon ſo to think, he cannot but ſtand as it were in admiration, that there ſhould be any one that cannot ſee what he ſees, whereupon
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:150539:17"/> unleſs as ſoon as he hath in a word hinted his reaſon, his oppoſite grants him his ſaying, as though it were manifeſt that he refuſed out of perverſeneſs and obſtinacy, he grows all in a choler, and ten to one if he come not to reproach and railing. Now for as much as a mind moved and diſturbed with paſſion can neither underſtand nor rightly judg of what is ſaid; if the <hi>erroneous perſon,</hi> over and beſides the weak, unfit confutation of his <hi>Error,</hi> ſhal have his mind diſturbed with evil language (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is frequently done by thoſe that find themſelves to have the advantage of the ground) much leſs wil he be able to acknowledg his <hi>Error.</hi> Such alſo is the diſpoſition of man, naturally prone to pride and over great haughtineſs of mind, that, if it were poſſible, he would be thought in every thing to go beyond others. So that much againſt his wil it is to give the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence to any, or to confeſs his failings, &amp; look what thing a man hath leaſt mind to do, it wil be moſt difficult to make him underſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that it is his duty to do the ſame. This may be ſeen in thoſe that go to law about any matter; how hard a thing is it to perſwade him that makes an unjuſt claim to what is not his own, or that wil not part with what is another mans, that he deals unjuſtly? And look how much greater the heat of his mind is grown by contending, by ſo much the more hard it wil be to make him give place to reaſon and equity. So that if ſo be, over and beſides, that thou ſhalt unaptly and darkly lay open and prove his <hi>error</hi> to the <hi>perſon erring,</hi> that thou ſhalt diſturb his mind by cutting language, this inconvenience ſhal be added, namely, that thou ſhalt unſeaſonably aggravate the greatneſs and foulneſs of his <hi>Error,</hi> wondring that any man could ever be ſo blockiſh and ſottiſh as to be ſo foully overſeen, with ſuch like expreſſions; by thus doing thou ſhalt deprive him of the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his judgment and make him ſtark mad. So that he ſhal be able to do nothing leſs then ſo much as ſuſpect, much leſs acknowledg and confeſs his <hi>Error.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If therefore ſuch things as theſe ſhal be allowed in our debates: that, he which being in an <hi>Error</hi> himſelf hath ſeduced others, ſhal not have his <hi>Error</hi> clearly demonſtrated unto him; he which takes upon him to oppoſe ſhal not underſtand what the ſeducer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms and ſo ſhal not refute it, but what himſelf by a falſe ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath imagined, and ſhal defend the doctrine received not with ſuch reaſons as he ought to do, but with ſuch ſilly ones as raſhneſs and a mind madded with anger could collect, which may
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:150539:18"/> be eaſily refelled; and the <hi>erroneous perſon</hi> ſhal have cauſe to think himſelf not vanquiſhed, but with many and grievous inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries after an inſolent manner abuſed: ſuch diſputes, however they may ſeem intended to reſiſt the Devil, yet are they ſo far from fruſtrating any of his plots, as that nothing could be invented more expedient to promote his deſigns. For they do not fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Errors</hi> but make them invincible; they do not pluck them up but ſpread them abroad; they do not deſtroy, but propagate them, and that in a wonderful manner. They render <hi>Errors</hi> invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, becauſe when the perſon <hi>erring</hi> finds it eaſie to avoyd the dint of ſuch arguments as are brought to oppoſe him, it gives him great occaſion to think that there cannot any thing more ſtrong be objected againſt him; and when he ſhal ſee confuted, not his own reaſons, but I know not what other arguments, ſuch as he never ſo much as once thought of, he may very wel think the cauſe to be, that not having any thing they could oppoſe againſt his arguments, and yet deſirous to ſeem to have anſwered them, they have cavilled at and miſ-interpreted his words. Hereupon he is altogether com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to conclude with himſelf, that not he, but his oppoſites are in the <hi>Error.</hi> And if there be joyned ſharp, inſolent, and injurious language, yea and, it may be, threats too and ſuch like, what can he do other but ſtrongly perſwade himſelf that his adverſaries being unable to defend their cauſe by dint of Argument, have guarded and fortified themſelves meerly with force and inſolence. And ſince hatred is bred of injuries, what is there that can ſettle <hi>Errors</hi> with greater pertinacy? And when a man ſhal leave his poſterity, heirs both of his <hi>Errors</hi> and his <hi>Hate;</hi> it comes to paſs that they can never be rooted up out of the minds of men. Thus is the people divided into Sects which hate one another with deadly feud, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from no kind of injuries, and taking the more liberty unto themſelves in this kind, in that men do not obſerve how in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they obey their own paſſions, but think they very much pleaſe God; whereas, in the mean time, by this means they incur the wrath of God daily more and more, and become enveloped with thicker clouds of darkneſs. Such diſputes do ſpread <hi>Errors</hi> abroad, becauſe the clamours there made, the brawls thence ariſing afford much occaſion of diſcourſe to many people, and according to the diverſity of mens minds and Judgements
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:150539:18"/> matters are very variouſly both reported and reſented. And it is wont to fall out, that if many diſlike the Error, yet ſome wil approve of it, yea and ſome wil as much diſapprove of the means uſed to reſiſt the Error, <hi>viz.</hi> inſolence, reproaches and the like, as of the Error it ſelf, and wil thereupon begin leſs to like of thoſe that ſet themſelves to oppoſe the Error, whence it may come to paſs that they may the more eaſily admit ſome other Error afterwards. He that likes the Error, can hardly refrain in his nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to favour that part he approves, ſo as to add, leave out, change many paſſages at his pleaſure, and thus by a kind of Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion the evil is ſpread far and near. In a word, by controverſies ill-managed, errors are propagated and bred divers ways. For firſt, he that oppoſes himſelf againſt an Error, can hardly avoid but that he himſelf ſhal fall into ſome Error, either becauſe (as the Proverb ſpeaks) while he ſhuns <hi>Charybdis,</hi> he ſlips into <hi>Scylla,</hi> ignorant to keep the mean, as that man ſhould do, who in oppoſing thoſe that attribute all to the Word of God, and the reading thereof, not marking the neceſſity of the Spirit of God to be their guide and interpreter, to the right underſtanding; ſhould endeavour to reduce the minds of ſuch men to the meer inſpirations of the holy Ghoſt; whereas the ſpirit is ſo far to be looked at, as that the written word be not contemned and loſe its dignity, as if it were a matter of humane invention, and not of divine tradition; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he wil grant ſomewhat to the Adverſary not to be granted, which ſome of the ancient Fathers peradventure did, who in ſuch a manner reſiſted the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> as that they defiled the purity of Chriſtian tenets, with Philoſophical ratiocinations. Likewiſe it may fall out, that whiles thou thinkeſt to expreſs that Doctrine which thou holdeſt for truth, with more ſignificant and clear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, then it is in Scripture expreſſed, and better to ſhun oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of cavil (for the wit of man wil ever be more wary and wiſer then God) thou wilt uſe ſuch words or forms of expreſſion, as from whence another leſs true and godly tenet may ſometimes be collected. Furthermore, whereas on both ſides they are wont to produce many allegations, each for his own judgment as the caſe requires: if it fall out that ſtriving ſhal ſharpen and inflame their minds, you ſhal ſoon ſee on both ſides many matters affirmed and denied, which in a calm mood they would never have affirmed or
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:150539:19"/> denied; as the Poet ſpake, <hi>Furor arma miniſtrat,</hi> Rage weapons doth afford. Every dart accidentally offered is caught hold on, fury ſuffers not a man to mark what an one it is: and what ever hath raſhly ſcap't a man, eſpecially in the interim of the diſpute, Pride wil have it ratified and firm, and thereupon new controverſies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, and new errors in like manner without end. Yea it is ſeen that by diſputes both the matters themſelves and mens wits are confounded, truth is loſt, and many are brought to that paſs, as to perſwade themſelves that nothing can be certainly concluded, and ſo to caſt away all care of Religion. Yea and it ſeems impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to fall out, but that whiles men are perpetually wrangling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſome one point of Religion, they wil ſlight and forget many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and they perhaps of the chiefeſt note; and it wil grow to a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, that a godly man ſhal be diſtinguiſhed from an ungodly by this one thing (be his life what it wil) in that he ſeems to abhor, and exceedingly loath that Doctrine, which in ſome one or two points is accounted heretical. O that we could but ſee at one view, how many and how great <hi>overthrows</hi> Sathan hath given to the Kingdom of Chriſt, what deſolations he hath made by this one weapon of <hi>Controverſies;</hi> he muſt be a man of iron that could chuſe to weep. Nor do I now complain of thoſe fanatical ſpirits, the emiſſaries of <hi>Sathan,</hi> who never ceaſe ſowing curious, vaine, and impious controverſies: (for from them, what other could a man expect) but of thoſe rather, who being ſuch as love the true worſhip of God, deal unadviſedly in point of Controverſie, and never obſerve how through a certain care of Gods glory, and the preſervation of ſound Doctrine, though very raſh and headlong, they do many things, whereby whiles they think they do bravely advance the cauſe of Chriſt, they ſo far notwithſtanding do the work of the Divel, as that he can hardly tel what to deſire more. Neither do I ſpeak verily of a ſort of common unexperienc'd pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, but of ſome prime ones, the pillars of the Church, and they not only of this preſent age but of all, the Prophets and Apoſtles excepted. For I deſire to take leave ſometime to bewaile the Churches condition, and to beſtow my teares upon the common ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities. Hee that ſhares not in this fault, let him know wee meddle not with him in this place, we accuſe none by name; yea and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be that are thus faulty, whatſoever we ſay, therefore we
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:150539:19"/> ſay it, not to inveigh againſt them or to cauſe them to be cenſured; but that we might take away that corruption from out the Church, then which there cannot be a more deadly plague. We have not here denounced war againſt the perſons of men whom we deſire to be both ſaved and as much as may be honored, but againſt <hi>Satan.</hi> We proſecute only the things themſelves (as we have ſaid) which cannot be let alone without the certain ruin of the <hi>Church.</hi> Now if any ſhal ſuppoſe that this cannot be done, but they muſt be poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at, as it were, with the finger; I would fain know of ſuch men, whether of the two be more juſt and fitting, for me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard their credit and eſtimation or the common good and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Church: without all queſtion if they be ſuch indeed, as they would be taken for, lovers of God and of his honor, they wil not only take in good part this ſervice of ours, but alſo render great thanks to God, that by ſome one at length (whoever he be) he hath manifeſted, that thoſe counſels are not from him, which they would have judged ſo exceeding neceſſary for the <hi>Churches</hi> welfare. But if they be ſuch (which I in no wiſe ſuſpect) as eſteem of their own dignity above all things elſe, it could not ſtand with my duty to prefer their reputation before the honor of God and the ſafety and good eſtate of the Commonwealth. Neither verily was there any cauſe for me to prize their favor and good wil above the favor of God himſelf. O the ſottiſhneſs and ſtupidity of man! The Goſpel had gotten poſſeſſion of the whole world almoſt; ſo many contentions aroſe, ſo many ſtrifes, ſo many brawls concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the punctilio's of Religion and matters for the moſt part of ſmal moment, that by little and little it hath been almoſt loſt, only a certain few remainders were in a corner with much difficulty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. In our Age likewiſe, by the incredible goodneſs of God, ſome light aroſe upon us: What do we? Frighted by the example of our Anceſtors do we diligently inquire how it came to paſs, that the profeſſors of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> were firſt torn into <hi>Sects,</hi> then loſt both all regulation of manners and their pious holy doctrine toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that the moſt part of them retained not ſo much as the name of the Goſpel? O unheard of ſluggiſhneſs never to be enough lamented with tears of ſorrow! As if we had no example where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to beware, we go on with our eyes ſhut in the very ſame ſteps to overthrow all. Neither do we ſlip any practice whereby we may
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:150539:20"/> make greater deſolation then ever. How many ſects aroſe there of old, and grew to a vaſt greatneſs, at whoſe beginning, if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies had bin managed with ſome mildneſs and gentleneſs, with patience, modeſty, and Peacefulneſs, we ſhould never have heard of ſo much as their very names? But we, as ſoon as any one ſeems to ſet his foot beſide the Path, we think there is no other courſe to be taken, but ſtraightway to ſound a defiance, to fill the world with railings, reproaches, clamours; what ever comes to our tongues end, that we deem moſt fit to reſiſt the <hi>Error,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as oft times nothing can be leſs to the purpoſe: likewiſe men of <hi>Goatham,</hi> we bring oyl to quench the fire. Whereas now or never, when we ſtand moſt in need of ſober adviſement, let us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon wrath, away with <hi>Arrogance,</hi> away with <hi>clamours,</hi> and let Reaſon alone bear ſway in this buſineſs, neither let <hi>Satan,</hi> but the ſpirit of God guide our Reaſon.</p>
            <p>And in the firſt place let us beware again and again, that no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary <hi>Controverſie</hi> be raiſed. What if ſomewhat offend thy eare as ſtrange and uncouth? The apprehenſion of thine own abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, muſt it preſently ſet thee a work to oppoſe it? An unfitting Maſter, by whoſe perſwaſion and the Divels inſtigation upon every the leaſt occaſion, thou ſhouldſt raſhly turn al topſie turvie. I tel thee it is a ſmal matter, it's a dangerous buſineſs, there is more need of Councel then temerity in ſuch a caſe. For what if ſo be, that which thou haſt heard, have ſome appearance of novelty, when as there is indeed no ſuch matter, becauſe thou <hi>interpretedſt</hi> the words of him that ſpake it, different from his meaning? What a madneſs then would it be, when there is agreement in the things themſelves, to make contentions about words, and to play at fifty-cuffs with the Clouds. If thou hadſt but gone to the man, and ask't him friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and courteouſly what was his meaning, he explaining his own words, all occaſion of <hi>Controverſie</hi> had bin taken away. Yea if ſo be there be ſomewhat which is indeed new, it is not preſently the moſt adviſed courſe, to give eare to that ſame crafty ſower of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, ſounding to battle; but ſince as we have ſaid, a people is never in ſo great light, but that there are ſome miſts of darkneſs; we muſt firſt diligently examine, whether it agree with that Doctrine which is comprehended in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> leaſt it ſhould fall out, that whiles we ſhal think to reſiſt an <hi>Error,</hi> we become reſiſters
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:150539:20" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the <hi>truth.</hi> Now there is no man but wil willingly confeſs, that the <hi>truth</hi> ought never to be oppoſed, whatſoever ſhew of <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi> it may ſeem to have, howbeit to avoid ſo doing when occaſion ſhal require is the hardeſt thing in the world. For whatſoever <hi>Doctrine</hi> any man hath once drunk down, he cannot perſwade himſelf that it is untrue, but that what ever differs therefrom is falſe, and ſuch as he is bound to oppoſe that it may not be beleeved. Now if all men ſhal be thus diſpoſed, as to reject what ever ſavors of novelty, whatſoever <hi>Error</hi> ſhal be in the <hi>Church,</hi> it can by no means be extirpated, but rather, out of that one, many wil by little and little ſprout forth. What is there then to be done? Certainly this is undeniable, that if they which erre were ſo affected, that they would patiently with quiet and compoſed minds hear ſuch as differ from them, and diligently examine the force of their Reaſons, as thoſe that (whatſoever they think of themſelves) may poſſibly be in an <hi>Error;</hi> it wil fall out that the greater part wil be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from their <hi>Errors:</hi> and that therefore it is that they abide ſo obſtinate in them, becauſe they cannot ſo much as ſuſpect any <hi>Error;</hi> ſo that whoſoever would teach contrary to their judgment, they judg him to be preſently ſuppreſſed, not once having his cauſe heard. Who ſees not therefore, that it is good advice for ſuch men, not preſently to reject what ever they hear different from their own perſwaſions; but to pauſe a while and think every man with himſelf; to me indeed ſuch things ſeem true which I have hitherto with the multitude beleeved; but what if that befall me which betides very many, that I ſhould moſt err in that whereof I ſeem to be moſt certain. Why may I not heare the man firſt? why ſhould I not weigh what he ſaies. <hi>Pauls</hi> precept is, <hi>Deſpiſe not Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, prove all things, hold faſt that which is good.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.</note> Now I would very fain know of thee who ever thou art, that certainly thinkeſt thy ſelf free from all <hi>Error;</hi> do I ſay thinkeſt, yea rather who ſeeſt and feeleſt as much; which way thinkeſt thou may perſons erring be brought to ſuſpect that they are in an <hi>Error,</hi> that ſo they may be more attentive to ſuch as would deal with them? I ſuppoſe thou wilt grant by this Reaſon, that very many men do err, and they not only of the unlearned <hi>vulgar ſort,</hi> but very learned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (which the almoſt infinite number of <hi>Controverſies</hi> agitated amongſt them witneſs) ſo that while they think themſelves to be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:150539:21"/> undoubtedly in the right, they may be notwithſtanding involved in greateſt <hi>Errors;</hi> &amp; that they are wiſe, who remembring that they are men, and may be deceived as ſoon as any others (though they know not themſelves to <hi>erre</hi>) yet as being in a poſſibility of <hi>Error,</hi> do give diligent eare to ſuch as profeſs to teach them better, and that ſo, as not to allow of any thing without diligent ſearch, and imploring the help of Cod to that effect. Go to then; with whom wouldſt thou that this Reaſon and inſtance ſhould be of force? with them that think aright? I ſuppoſe thou wilt not ſay ſo, but with them that <hi>erre.</hi> But this is that I would know, <hi>viz.</hi> how thou canſt make this Reaſon more prevalent with thoſe that <hi>err,</hi> then with ſuch as <hi>err</hi> not? canſt thou do it by alleadging that they are in an <hi>error?</hi> they cannot think it poſſible that they ſhould <hi>err;</hi> and that is it which the Reaſon produced aimes at, to bring them into ſome ſuſpition of <hi>Error.</hi> if ſo be then, that thoſe who <hi>err,</hi> do think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be as far from <hi>Error,</hi> as they that think aright, yea verily for the moſt part are more confident of the two, for a fool (as the wiſe mean ſpeaks) is delighted with his own reaſonings, but a wiſe man asks counſel; truly, I can ſee no other way, in caſe <hi>Error</hi> be in the <hi>Church,</hi> to make it to be acknowledged, then to make this general concluſion: that foraſmuch as it is a property of Mankind to <hi>err,</hi> no one perſon that is but a meer man ought to be ſo confident, as to perſwade himſelf he cannot <hi>err,</hi> and that what ever come into <hi>Controverſie,</hi> he ſhould but in vain give eare to what any man ſhal ſay concerning the ſame. But we muſt not (wilt thou ſay) doubt in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Religion, but know aſſuredly what to hold. So ſay I too, and therefore this knot is very hard to unty. To reſiſt the <hi>Truth,</hi> and not to acknowledg and reject an <hi>Error,</hi> if there be any that can make it appear, is a very great evil. But impoſſible it is, that he which <hi>errs</hi> ſhould acknowledg his <hi>Error,</hi> before he come to think it poſſible that he may <hi>err,</hi> whereby he ſhould be content to give eare to any that would convince him; and yet a man muſt not waver in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Religion: which way now, and by what thrid ſhal we get out of ſuch an intricate labyrinth? Let us not deſpair yet, we muſt, and wil find a way out. Thus much we have concluded upon, that truth is never to be oppoſed, and that he which <hi>errs,</hi> whiles he is in an <hi>Error,</hi> cannot underſtand he <hi>errs;</hi> likewiſe that it hinders much the acknowledgment of the <hi>truth,</hi> for
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:150539:21" rendition="simple:additions"/> any one to perſwade himſelf ſtrongly that he is in no <hi>Error,</hi> and that the right way, and firſt ſtep to the acknowledgment of an <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> is to have a ſuſpition thereof. Shal we then allow a perpetual heſitation in matters of Faith? That we wil not neither. I conceive it rather our duty to endeavour, to attain to the moſt certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that may be had. What other courſe ſhal we take? For as much as a man may, concerning a point, be either wel perſwaded, believing as the thing is, or ill, beleeving otherwiſe then the thing is; and for as much as he that is wel perſwaded may be either perfectly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, which befals him that hath obtained a certain and clear knowledg, or imperfectly perſwaded, which is ſeen in them who imbrace the <hi>truth</hi> indeed, but are led only by opinion, not being able to give a ſure reaſon why they ſo think: certain it is, that man who hath ſo ſure a knowledg, as to be able to render true, conſtant, and infallible cauſes of his judgment, cannot be brought to doubt, or to be ſeduced concerning the point. Whence it follows that whatever cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> give him, that he ſuſpect himſelf of <hi>error,</hi> it can noway hinder him in reſpect of thoſe things wherof he hath ſuch knowledg; much leſs can it hurt him that is tainted with ill opinions. For he that ſo errs, as to ſuſpect himſelf of <hi>error,</hi> doth not now altogether err, but inclines partly to <hi>error</hi> partly to <hi>truth.</hi> It remains then that we conſider, what we may think of ſuch, as imbracing true opinions, have not however attained to the perfect <hi>ſcience</hi> of the things themſelves. In ſuch perſons truly ſuſpition of <hi>error</hi> is no other then a certain approach to <hi>error,</hi> which in it ſelf we cannot but judg naught: howbeit for a man falſly to <hi>arrogate</hi> unto himſelf know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, when he hath only an opinion, is an <hi>error.</hi> Now as <hi>error</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be good, ſo it is an evil thing to be in danger of any pernicious <hi>error.</hi> But he that is led by opinions only, and is not ſure of what he holds, may poſſibly be led into <hi>error.</hi> He is then in danger leſt it may ſo fal out, whereas the beſt way is to be free from all danger. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, like a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, though all pain be reckoned among evils, yet if it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone for the removing of ſome grievous diſeaſe, it appears in the notion of a great good; ſo, opinion being an infirm &amp; feeble know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and if not a diſeaſe yet a conſtitution of the mind neer approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to a diſeaſe, he that ſhal caſt into a mans mind a ſuſpition of <hi>error,</hi> by inſtancing in ſo many men, that while they dream'd of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs, did yet walk in greateſt darkneſs; to the end he may ſhew him the way to attain to a ſure and ſtedfaſt knowledg: we ought
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:150539:22"/> to judg this man, not to give pernicious but healthful and very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary counſel. To the end therefore that thou mayſt not oppoſe at any time, and trouble a man that would teach the <hi>Truth,</hi> either thou muſt of neceſſity attain unto a certain firm knowledg of what ever may at any come time into <hi>Controverſie</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> which what a piece of work it wil be any man may judg; or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if at any time thou ſhalt hear any matter which ſounds new in thine ear, before thou condemneſt it, thou muſt pauſe a while and think with thy ſelf what kind of knowledg thou haſt of that thing. And leſt thou be deceived, taking a vehement perſwaſion for certain ſcience, let us conſider what we are to account ſcience and what opinion; and this it becomes us to do, not as <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> but as the Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> There is nothing more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain then that we (in point of <hi>Religion</hi>) can hold nothing for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain but from the teſtimony of Gods Word. This many texts of Scripture witneſs: let theſe few ſerve in ſtead of many. <hi>David</hi> himſelf King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and a famous Prophet, when he had reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to build a Temple to the Lord; yet could he not divine the mind of God in that point: Neither did <hi>Nathan</hi> a great Prophet likewiſe come neerer the mind of God, in his exhorting <hi>David</hi> to perform his purpoſe; for by him God forbad <hi>David</hi> to build any Temple, which is a conſiderable inſtance. Now of <hi>Joſhua</hi> the ſucceſſor of <hi>Moſes,</hi> it is written that <hi>he was indued with the spirit of wiſdom,</hi> and that <hi>God promiſed to be with him perpetually,</hi> yet is he commanded <hi>to have regard to fulfil the Law which he had received from</hi> Moſes, <hi>and not to turn from it to the right hand or to the left;</hi> and the reaſon why is added; <hi>that thou mayſt know</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>what thou oughteſt to do.</hi> Whence we may underſtand, that then we are ſure of thing if we have a Word of God for it. But how plainly have we this in another place? <hi>My thoughts are not like your thoughts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſaiah.</note> 
               <hi>ſaith the Lord: neither are my reaſons like your reaſons; but look how much the Heaven is higher then the Earth, ſo much are my thoughts above your thoughts, and my reaſons above your reaſons.</hi> Neither is it ſufficient in any ſort to build upon the divine Scriptures on any faſhion; but it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that we attain the knowledg of them by the interpretation of the <hi>holy spirit;</hi> for as much as we ſee ſo many differing judgments in matter of Religion, even amongſt the moſt learned and moſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:150539:22" rendition="simple:additions"/> exerciſed in the reading of holy Scriptures. For <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifies; <hi>that only the Spirit of God knows the things of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.</note> 
               <hi>neither doth mans ſenſe underſtand the things of the Spirit; neither can he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, for they ſeem to be fooliſhneſs unto him: but the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual man judgeth all things.</hi> Whereupon <hi>James</hi> exhorts him that wants wiſdom to ask it of God. From all which it is gathered, that he hath the knowledg of divine things, who both depends only on the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and hath attained the true underſtanding thereof by help of no other interpreter but the Spirit of God himſelf. And all this wil they willingly grant to whom we now addreſs our ſpeech. But here is coucht a great difficulty. For many perſwade themſelves that they can prove what they hold from teſtimony of Gods Word, &amp; that the ſpirit of God is their guide and teacher to furniſh them with the underſtanding thereof, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding err monſtrouſly. They ſuppoſe they begged of God for his <hi>Spirit</hi> and that they have placed all their confidence in his aſſiſtance, who are not aware in the mean while that their truſt hath been in any thing rather then in him. But before thou canſt conclude of a ſurety that thou haſt obtained his Spirit and learned any thing by the guidance thereof, what ever thing there is which might move thee to think ſo or ſo, or confirm a perſwaſion taken up, ſuch as is an opinion of thine own or anothers knowledg, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſpirit, holineſs; likewiſe the multitude of thoſe that think as thou thinkeſt, or of thoſe which praiſe thee, admire thee, depend upon thy judgment; alſo the long while that the opinion oppoſed hath been in repute; finally, whatſoever is not God or his Word, from it thou oughteſt to withdraw thine eyes, thy mind, and all thy thoughts, no leſs then if there were no ſuch thing in the world; and then all other hope and confidence being caſt away, to fix thine eyes and mind on God alone, to depend only upon him, and thus affected in this poſture to ask his Spirit. Thus if thou ſhalt do, if frequently, if ſeriouſly, if believingly thou ſhalt do it; then mayſt thou with good reaſon conclude, that thou art not poſſeſſed with any pernicious <hi>Error,</hi> or in caſe thou art poſſeſſed with any, that it ſhal be made known to thee. But theſe things are ſuch as we can with much more facility expreſs them in words then in deeds, ſo liable is the diſpoſition of man to <hi>Error;</hi> yea ſo apt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally is he to put truſt in any thing rather then God. In a word,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:150539:23"/> ſo ſly, ſo induſtrious, ſo wel furniſhed is <hi>Sathan</hi> with divers Arts to deceive: that when thou haſt done all thou canſt, it wil be an hard matter in ſome point or other not to be overſeen. Which I would not have any man think, I therefore ſpeak, as ſuppoſing there can be no certainty in divine matters, which conceit I am as far from as he that is fartheſt. But this is that which I would by no means ſuffer, that he which as yet is arrived unto no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and is <hi>peradventure</hi> plunged as yet in falſe opinions, ſhould <hi>arrogate</hi> unto himſelf knowledg; but I would have him endeavor to get it indeed, and endeavor as he ought to do. He that hath once attained clear and certain knowledg, exhort him as long as you wil, and let him endeavor as much as he can to ſuſpect himſelf of <hi>Error,</hi> yet ſhal he never be able to entertain any ſuch ſuſpition of himſelf. Such kind of exhortations then, can move ſuſpitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only in them, who either <hi>err</hi> or have not yet attained firm and conſtant knowledg, but may attain the ſame as yet: to whom whiles the right way of attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereto is ſhewn, and they are admoniſhed of what blocks and trapps in their way they ought to take heed, truly I cannot ſee but that the counſel we give them is very ſafe and profitable. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that a man may not any ways offend by oppoſing the <hi>Truth</hi> either in publick or private, by word of mouth or by writing, I would perſwade him by all means poſſible, that whatever his judgment be concerning Religion, he would examine particularly by what Reaſons he hath bin moved to be ſo perſwaded, with what diligence, with what aſſurance of the ſpirits aſſiſtance, he hath ſearched the Scriptures, with what circumſpection and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he hath withdrawn his eyes from whatever is neither God nor his Word, alſo with what confidence he hath powred forth his praiers to God, in a word, how far he is aſſured of whatever he holds. How be it, when thou ſhalt have done all this with as much care as poſſible thou canſt (modeſty being always pleaſing to God and he of ſuch a nature as that he cannot deſpiſe the prayers of that man, who begs a daily encreaſe of the certainty of his faith) if yet ſomewhat appearing new and therefore falſe and impious ſhal wound thine eares, as yet I conceive it the beſt way, that before thou oppoſe, thou pauſe a while and think with thy ſelf again and again, what aſſurance thou haſt, that ſuch a ſpeech is falſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious: and that again thou wraſtle with God by moſt fervent
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:150539:23" rendition="simple:additions"/> prayers, that if thou beeſt in the right, he would confirm thee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in more and more; if humane frailty have overtaken thee, that he would open thine eyes and give thee ſo much light, as to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and renounce thine <hi>Error.</hi> For <hi>if we who are evil</hi> (as our Lord ſaid) <hi>are ſo affected, that we give good things to our children, ſo as when they ask bread we give them not a ſtone; nor a ſerpent when they ask a fiſh:</hi> What ſhal we think of our <hi>heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi> Shal we think that he, while we never leave asking of him the certainty of the <hi>truth,</hi> being enflamed with a deſire of obeying his wil, and fearing leſt by <hi>Error</hi> we ſhould wage <hi>War</hi> againſt the <hi>Truth;</hi> ſhal we (I ſay) think, that in ſtead of aſſurance of the <hi>truth</hi> he wil give us <hi>errors,</hi> in ſtead of <hi>light</hi> he wil ſend us <hi>darkneſs?</hi> How far were this both from his infinite goodneſs and his moſt faithful promiſes? Again, ſince (as we have ſaid) we can be aſſured of nothing unleſs we be taught of God, neither can we in our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers limit God a time within which he ſhould teach us, though we have turned away our ſight from all things beſides God, though we have placed all our confidence in God, it may notwithſtanding come to paſs, that we are not as yet taught by God, but that he is about to teach us by him, whom we account to be a ſeducer; for if he had already taught us, he would have added ſo much light and certainty, that we ſhould have had no reaſon to doubt; only let us beware leſt <hi>Satan</hi> put a trick upon us; we muſt remember what a crafty fox he is, how old an impoſtor, how plauſibly (to uſe the Apoſtles phraſe) he can deceive in the perſon of an <hi>Angel of light:</hi> and let us make ſure account that no body can beware of him too much. Let us abandon that ſame expreſſion, its an old <hi>Error</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently confuted, long ſince confuted; what if ſo be the point have been hitherto ill-maintained, what if hitherto <hi>Satan</hi> hath playd the part of <hi>Oppoſer</hi> and <hi>Maintainer</hi> himſelf alone. But be it ſo, ſuppoſe it to be an <hi>Error;</hi> if it be but to draw the perſons erring by thine example unto that ſame gentleneſs and readineſs to hear which is requiſite, that they may not be obſtinate towards ſuch as would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them, be thou thy ſelf ſo gentle, as firſt to hear and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand before thou condemn them. If it be but that they may not have reaſon to complain, that their cauſe hath been condemned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was heard. What? wil the <hi>Truth</hi> become leſs apparent by the often diſcuſſion, and not rather every day more certain &amp; clear?
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:150539:24"/> Nothing verily is more eaſie then to begin a contention, but when it is once begun it is far more hard to end it, So that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpake to this purpoſe moſt fitly, when he compared the beginner of <hi>ſtrife</hi> to him that opens a way to <hi>water</hi> (ſuppoſe collected into ſome great and vaſt lake) for at firſt indeed the matter may ſeem ſmal &amp; contemptible, but the water makes it ſelf a larger &amp; deeper paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, grows ſtronger and ſtronger, bears away the banks, lays waſt all it meets with, eats it ſelf channels, covers the fields with ſand and mud, plucks trees up by the roots, throws down buildings and makes a rueful ſpectacle where ever it comes; juſt ſo from ſmal and contemptible beginnings of <hi>Controverſie</hi> &amp; <hi>ſtrife,</hi> we ſee at laſt the whole world filled with diſſentions, calumnies and clamors. So that he which conceives not himſelf bound to ſhun the moving of a <hi>controverſie,</hi> as being one of the greateſt evils, unleſs he be meerly compelled thereunto, ſhews himſelf to be either a man of no judgment, or one that cares not a ruſh for the <hi>Churches</hi> wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. Wherefore though it be apparent that it is a falſe <hi>Tenet</hi> which is ſpread abroad, yet before thou begin to contend in the leaſt meaſure about it, thou muſt conſider of what moment and weight the thing is. For concerning vain queſtions we have a command of <hi>Paul,</hi> not to refute whatever ſhal be falſly aſſerted, but to avoyd the queſtions themſelves. So that I conceive our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty only is to endeavor that mens minds may be diverted from ſuch curious unprofitable queſtions, not ſo much in regard they may be falſe, but rather leſt they vainly conſume pretious time, beſides that it often fals out that while men ſtrive about the ſlighteſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that can be, while mens wits are diſturbed by the heat of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, ſuch things may be raſhly alledged on both ſides, as being of greater weight, may not a little impair the purity of Doctrin. Add herunto that men fal as ſoon to reproaching, railing, ſcolding when they contend about a tale of <hi>Robinhood,</hi> as when the <hi>controverſie</hi> is concerning the moſt weighty ſubject, which are faults that a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> heart ought exceedingly to abhor. But here you wil ſay is the great difficulty, the great labor to diſtinguiſh between queſtions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable and queſtions that contain matter of damnable <hi>Error.</hi> For whatever a man ſhal pitch his mind upon, preſently <hi>Satan</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to perſwade him that it is a weighty point, ſo that unleſs he know aſſuredly what to hold, he cannot aſſure himſelf of any hope
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:150539:24" rendition="simple:additions"/> of ſalvation. Verily this is my judgment, that he, who not out of vain curioſity or ambition to become a ſubtile diſputant in matters divine, but out of true piety towards God and an earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of his own ſalvation is exerciſed in the reading of the Word of God, wil eaſily know what queſtions are fooliſh &amp; vain, and which are unworthy to be handled. But for as much as many are much to ſeek in this point, not without the Churches great detriment; it wil not be impertinent, to make enquiry after ſome ſure way whereby a man may without miſtake diſcern the one ſort of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions from the other.</p>
            <p>This then is paſt peradventure, if there be ſome one thing, at which as the <hi>mark</hi> and <hi>end</hi> all the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> doth aim, whatever thing being known conduceth nothing to the <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment</hi> of that end, all queſtioning about that thing wil be vain. Wherefore it concerns us to ſee, if there be any ſuch end; what it is, and what thoſe things be which may conduce thereunto. Now <hi>John</hi> teſtifies that ſuch an end there is, and what it is, in theſe words <hi>Many other ſigns alſo Jeſus did, which are not contained in this Book, but theſe are written that ye may beleeve that Jeſus is the Meſſiah the Son of God, and that beleeving ye may obtain life by him.</hi> By which words we are plainly taught, that the end &amp; ſcope of <hi>Chriſtian Doctrine</hi> is <hi>eternal life,</hi> whereupon it follows, that whatſoever may be of any uſe for the attaining of <hi>eternal life,</hi> that thing may be accounted profitable to be known, and whatſoever can confer nothing to that end ought not to be regarded. How now! (may ſome man ſay) not a word of the honor and glory of God in this conſideration? I anſwer; whatſoever things make for the glory of God, without doubt, the knowledg of all ſuch things further our ſalvation, neither is the glory of God in any thing more manifeſted then in the ſalvation of man. If ſo be then there be any thing that we are obliged to do to the end we may attain <hi>eternal life,</hi> for as much as we cannot do that thing, unleſs we ſhal under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that it is our duty ſo to do the ſame, it is neceſſary that we know ſo much. And for as much as God hath made a Law which who ſo keeps not exactly, hath impoſed upon him the puniſhment of eternal deſtruction; which Law becauſe a man cannot keep, and there is ſome other thing, which if he do he ſhall notwithſtanding obtain ſalvation; he ought to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:150539:25"/> both that he cannot ſatisfie the Law, and what that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing is which if he ſhal do wil be a means to ſave him. And ſeeing that ſame other thing is; if he ſhal be perſwaded, that the Son of God being made man ſatisfied his <hi>Father</hi> in reſpect of the puniſhment due unto his ſins, and that he is by his blood made clean from all the defilement of ſin; howbeit holineſs of life and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency of converſation is required, not that in confidence thereof we ſhould promiſe our ſelves ſalvation; but that our manners may be ſuch as becomes the children and ſervants of God, bought with ſo great a price: Theſe things (I ſay) being ſo, it is neceſſary both that a man know the promiſes which are made concerning <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that he be not ignorant wherein holineſs and innocency of life and converſation do conſiſt. And for as much as there are many things which may either induce us to place all hope of our ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Chriſt</hi> and (according to our power) to keep the commands of God, or hinder us from ſo doing and delay us, it is very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to know what thoſe things are which may either help or hinder. Now we are perſwaded to place all our confidence in God and enflamed to love him, by which love we are drawn to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor obedience to his Commandments, by the knowledg of his <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> not as <hi>Philoſophers</hi> deſire to know it that they may ſubtilly argue about it, but ſo as to underſtand how he is beyond all conceit wiſe, good, gentle, merciful, how exact and punctual he is in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his promiſes. That his <hi>nature</hi> is ſuch his works witneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Creation</hi> of the world and all things therein contained, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially examples of his care for ſuch as have worſhipped him with a pious and holy fear, how he hath helped them in times of exigency, how he is wont to defend them from the lying in wait of the Devil and the world; alſo how great and grievous ſinners he hath upon their repentance comforted and ſaved; how great a hater nevertheleſs of ſin he is wont to ſhew himſelf; and the like. To the knowledg of his <hi>nature,</hi> the remembrance of his frequently repeated promiſes being joyned, doth exceedingly confirm and ſtrengthen faith, and forcibly puts men upon a ſerious reſolution of amendment of life. Hereunto may be added the explication of Propheſies, eſpecially ſuch as concern the preſent times, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a clear teſtimony of the providence of God, make exceedingly to the confirmation of mens minds. Whatſoever matters of this
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:150539:25" rendition="simple:additions"/> nature are very profitable to be known and diſcourſed of by all men at home and abroad in private and in publick. And becauſe we can perform none of thoſe things lately mentioned, unleſs aſſiſted by the help and <hi>spirit</hi> of God, and God wil have us ask this <hi>spirit</hi> and aſſiſtance of him, we muſt both know that God would have us ſo to do, and keep in mind the promiſes that he wil give us theſe things upon our asking, in a word, we muſt in no caſe be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in what manner we ought to call upon God and how we ought to render to him thanks for benefits received. Contrariwiſe, we ſhal be much hindred concerning the premiſes, if we ſhal judg otherwiſe concerning the <hi>nature</hi> of God, concerning his wil and whatever may come to paſs, then his Word directs us. A great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance too is the corruption of our <hi>nature,</hi> which very forcibly withdraws our mind and thoughts, yea raviſhes us to contrary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. Whereupon we being neceſſitated to wage perpetual war with our inbred pravity, to the end we may render our nature ſubject to the divine wil, it is in like manner very neceſſary that we know our <hi>natural ſinfulneſs</hi> and whatever the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſhews us for the mitigation and ſubduing thereof. And for as much as it is not ſufficient that a man care for himſelf alone, but every man is bound according to the meaſure of the <hi>spirit</hi> he hath received and the courſe of life whereunto he is called to ſeek the good of the whole <hi>Church,</hi> not only of the Members thereof now living, but likewiſe of poſterity; whatſoever is of that tendency as to make any doctrine profitable to life hard to be attained, or may give occaſion either to forſake or lightly to eſteem the ſame, it is of great conſequence that we be not ignorant thereof. And in as much as the <hi>Scriptures</hi> admoniſh us that we have a great and moſt cunning adverſary (who is named from his enmity) who without ceaſing plots againſt us whereby to ruin us and divert us from God; who can doubt but that it wilbe very profitable, wel to underſtand his arts and by what wiſ om they are to be avoyded? in a word, no doctrin can be profitable unleſs it have ſome uſe; if it conſiſt only in ſpeculation &amp; tend to no a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:150539:26"/> that there be not other points that wil eaſily ſupply the defect thereof. That this is ſo, appears, becauſe it being neceſſary that we ſhould beleeve that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> the Savior foretold by the Prophets, and to this end all the miracles which he did were dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that thereby it might be known who he was, yet were they not all committed to writing, but ſuch and ſo many as were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that men might readily know who he was. So that if ſo be any ſhould content that our Lord wrought ſome miracle not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in thoſe books which we have of his life and doings, it would not be worth the while to ſearch out the <hi>truth</hi> of that matter, or to make <hi>Controverſie thereabout,</hi> foraſmuch as though it ſhould be found to be true, there could be no other profit reap'd thereby, but that <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhould be prov'd to come from God, and to be the man he pretended himſelf to be, which thing many other miracles do ſo fully witneſs, which are out of queſtion, that greater cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty cannot be deſired: on the contrary, though we had no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of any ſuch miracle, the Authority of other miracles recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Scripture by the holy pen-men thereof, is not a jot thereby diminiſhed. Whereby it would come to paſs, that whether we ſhal beleeve that miracle or beleeve it not, we ſhould neither win nor loſe by the means. And foraſmuch as, in caſe Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſhould ſeem to contain any abſurdity, or to maintain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, it would hinder thoſe that are unconverted from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the ſame; whatever tends to the removing of ſuch abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, and to reconcile ſuch contradictions, cannot but be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, Unleſs happily ſuch reconciliations cannot be accompliſhed without great ſtirs, <hi>Controverſies,</hi> and diſſentions. By ſuch like ways then, it ſeems eaſy to know profitable queſtions from vain and unprofitable, provided that mens judgments be not before hand diſturbed with partiality and the heat of contention; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have already begun to contend about the point in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as about ſome weighty matter: but when men are once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched as it were with the opinion hereof, their inbred pride, hatred, indignation, cuſtome in <hi>Error,</hi> and <hi>Sathan</hi> ſuffer not their judgment to execute its office. Who amongſt us at this day doth not admire, that the ancient profeſſors of Chriſtianity did contend with ſuch heat and earneſtneſs of mind, about the day on which <hi>Eaſter</hi> (as they call it) was to be celebrated, and about other
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:150539:26" rendition="simple:additions"/> matters of very light concernment; whereas in thoſe times, they were thought very weighty points: we looking upon them with unbiaſſed judgments, plainly perceive, what an unworthy thing it was for the Church of God to be divided into ſects, upon ſo ſlight occaſions. My adviſe therefore is, that as ſoon as thou ſhalt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſomewhat untrue to be taught, before thou ſet thy ſelf to contradict it, thou conſider if it be not a matter of little or no weight, and if it be, that thou make no contention about it; or, according to that opportunity which the time, place thine own perſon, and his thou ſhalt deal with, may afford, that thou do on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhort the man to leave ſuch ſpeculations and apply himſelf to more weighty matters, and I would have thee do it as artificially as may be, ſo as not to put him into any paſſion. But the true way of bringing men from vain queſtions is this; if thoſe whoſe place it is either to teach the people, or to read divinity in the Schools, and thoſe that apply themſelves to write, omitting curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous queſtions, and abandoning vain oſtentation of wit, would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon and urge only ſuch points as tend to the confirmation of faith, to the exptirpation of vice, to inſtil the fear of God, cheriſh piety, comfort the afflicted, and keep them from deſperation, to keep ſuch as would be counted Chriſtian brethren, in brotherly love, with a ſweet harmony of affections, and the like. Neither are theſe Subjects ſuch as are to be ſlighted for their commoneſs. For in the firſt place, though the heads themſelves of ſuch Doctrine are not very many, yet they are of very large extent, and then, all weary ſomneſs in the auditor may be taken away by the variety of handling them; eſpecially if the preachers of the Goſpel ſhal mark, what Doctrines at every ſeaſon the people moſt ſtand in need of. As in caſe they be lift up by proſperity, and give the reyn to luxury, let them fear them by the prophetical threatnings, and ſo reduce them into order. If affliction lye heavy upon them, let them be comforted: If they languiſh with ſluggiſhneſs, let them be ſtirred up to honeſt imployments. If they ſeem too intent upon the world, let them be admoniſhed of the ſhortneſs of this life and diverted from too much care for worldly things, and thus let them inſiſt upon ſuch Doctrines as are moſt ſuitable to every ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Neither ſee I cauſe why we ſhould count thoſe arguments too common, which can never ſufficiently be imprinted in our minds.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:150539:27"/> So that time wil always be wanting for ſuch arguments, ſo far ſhal we be from wanting matter to take up the time, though we keep within the bounds preſcribed. Now this is that which may often give occaſion to ſtart vain queſtions, if in expounding the holy Scriptures to the people, a man ſhal as it were make a Law to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to dwel long upon every word without diſtinction; which ſeems now to be the common practiſe. For when they cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways find profitable matter to diſcourſe of, they are forced to give way to curioſity. Such men there be haply, who being ful of matter and abundant in wit, and therefore able to take an occaſion of diſcourſing upon what Subject they pleaſe, from any text or word; may handle largely any Scripture, without juſt cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. But this is not every mans Lot (as it is in the Proverb) <hi>Non omnibus datu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt adire Corinthum.</hi> They that are not ſo wel ſtored, ſhal do much more diſcreetly, if they wil ſuit their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors to their abilities. Where many things profitable to be heard ſuggeſt themſelves, let them inſiſt long, if the text afford not many things, let them not be aſhamed to put a little ſhoo on a little foot, and to proceed in their explication the faſter. For what matters it, if having made twenty Sermons upon ſome one Chapter of the Goſpel, thou ſhalt go over the next in one diſcourſe? The holy Ghoſt would not teach all things in every place, but one in one place, another in another. Neither let they knowledg be all powred forth upon one place, though thou mighteſt do it hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely enough, much leſs be thou ſo abſurd and unreaſonable, as to deſire rather to deſcend to fooliſh commentations, or to incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ſuch matters as all thy auditors eares are already ful of, then to be thought not to have made many Sermons upon the explication of every word. Some offend in this kind to make fooliſh oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their fulneſs, others offend by giving more heed to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of ſome preachers, then to what is neceſſary to be done. Yea and much greater occaſion there is of ſuch curioſity in reſpect of thoſe which expound the Scriptures in Univerſities. For ſince there be already many commentaries upon them in print, which the <hi>Students</hi> themſelves may read, and the profeſſors are loath that their labor ſhould be thought vain or of ſmal neceſſity; that they ſhould only repeat other mens expoſitions, meditations, arguments, and their very words; but deſire ſtil to have ſomewhat which the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:150539:27" rendition="simple:additions"/> Scholars ſhal not find in their books: beſides that they are compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to make things change their places, bringing what hath been fore-alleadged upon one place to the explication of another; that they may ſet forth their own acuteneſs, they do either invent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections that they might anſwer them; or they coyn new words and new manner of expreſſions, or they raiſe new <hi>Controverſies.</hi> Better it were in truth, that there were no profeſſors at all, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch as theſe. For what other thing wil they effect, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ſtudy of Religion into ſophiſtical vanities? What would you have them do, may ſome men ſay? What! truly any thing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then thus to miſpend their leaſure. What ſhould I deſire them to do, but not to deprave, not to pervert ſuch things as have bin ſaid to the purpoſe, and in fit place, not to darken and obſcure them by idle queſtions. And if any thing hath ſlipped former Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors, if they ſee any thing which they did not, herein let them make proof of their own diligence. But there is yet a worſe fault then this; many think it not enough to teach thus by word of mouth, but they wil have their commentaries in print, ſetting out large volumnes, that matter of wrangling doth every day encreaſe. How many Commentaries have we already upon <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans?</hi> Every day ſome or other new one comes forth. For every man that with ſome applauſe expounds it in the Schooles muſt needs ſet forth a Commentary. Howbeit ſhould you collect what he explains more aptly then others, or what he brings wholly of his own; your gleanings wil be very ſlender. The reſt wil be what other former writers either upon the ſame or ſome other place had formerly diſcourſed. And whereas our later Expoſitors do of purpoſe abſtain from the words of the former, and they for the moſt part had prepoſſeſſed the moſt fit forms of ſpeaking, which reliſhed more of the ſpirit and were moſt apt to move affection; theſe muſt of neceſſity uſe leſs fitting phraſes, ſuch as ſavor only of a vain oſtentation of wit, but leave no ſting of affection in the minds of the Readers. Thoſe who err in this kind through defect of judgment, ſuppoſing themſelves not unprofitably thus imployed, may with admonition be in ſome ſort excuſed. But as for ſuch as are ſpurred to write by oſtentation and ambition, I ſhal not ſtick to count ſuch men among the prime plagues of the Church, as perſons moſt wickedly hireing themſelves out to do the Divils work. But let us now proceed.</p>

               <p>WHen upon ſerious examination we have found that a point in queſtion is an Error of weighty concernment, what courſe we are to take. Satans aim is firſt to make a man imbrace an erroneous doctrine: If he cannot do that, his next endeavor wil be to inflame him with an inordinate, turbulent, paſſionate spirit of oppoſition againſt the ſaid Error, whereby whiles he thinks to ſuppreſs it he ſhal exceedingly aſſiſt Satan in the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation thereof. He that spreads and teaches an Error may be a dear, child of God, though left for a time. A pious perſon may and ought to be exceedingly moved to ſee the Name and Truth of God blaſphemed by a spreader of erroneous tenets, but it muſt be with a zeal rightly qualified, and which comes not from Satan, but the Spirit of God. The nature of a right zeal againſt a Seducer. Great difference to be made between him that being deceived him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf deceives others, and him that willingly, wittingly and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſeduceth. How a malitious ſeducer ought to be dealt with that he may deſiſt from ſeducing. Reproaches and criminations, not only unprofitable but hurtful both in reſpect of the ſeducer, the ſeduced, and thoſe whom we would preſerve from infection. If any good do come by reproaches and revilings, it may be otherwiſe and by better and ſafer ways obtained. To brand any man with tokens of infamy, belongs to none but the Magiſtrate: It ill becomes any private Chriſtian, eſpecially thoſe that are teachers of others. They muſt be free from all appearance of evil, and rather Gods then Men, that ſhal work any good upon ſeducers and ſeduced per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by reproaches. Two things of greateſt importance to reclaim a ſeducer, <hi>viz.</hi> to produce ſuch demonſtrations as may have greateſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:150539:28" rendition="simple:additions"/> power to convince him of his Error; and to provide that he may conſider the ſame with a calm, quiet, untroubled spirit. We muſt therefore carefully avoyd any words or behaviour that may move him to paſſion. We muſt avoyd cavilling at words and drawing abſurdities from his aſſertions. Many men delighted by miſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting their adverſaries words, to infer ſome great abſurdity. Many oppoſe their own imaginations in ſtead of their adverſaries errors. If our adverſary aſſert any thing which ſeems very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, we ought to ſuſpect that we do not rightly underſtand him, and rather to deſire him to explain himſelf then to triumph over the ſuppoſed abſurdity. God reveals matters divine to babes and ſucklings. Our adverſary is much wrought upon when he ſees we perfectly underſtand his meaning. Our chief endeavor ought to be perfectly to know what and how he holds. A great fault to charge our adverſaries with holding ſuch things as to our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings ſeem to follow from their tenets. We ought barely to report their ſayings without addition, detraction or alteration. All deſire of victory to be baniſh't from Chriſtian d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

What a man loſes in reputation of learning and knowledg, he gains in the eſtimation of candor, ingenuity, ſincerity when he lays down an Error. What meditations we ought to be converſant in before we begin a diſpute, to the end we may neither our ſelves be moved, nor move our adverſary to paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. A mans nobility, Wealth, Authority, Reputations are the weapons wherewith <hi>Satan.</hi> fights againſt him. The grand combate in all diſputes is with <hi>Satan.</hi> The main quarrel, is not ſo much the point in queſtion, as the Peace and Tranquillity, and ſafety
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:150539:29"/> of the Church of Chriſt. A diſputant muſt take heed of being too wiſe in his own eyes. No vice ſo hardly rooted out of a mans ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as Arrogance. A medicine againſt arrogance. The top of humane wiſdom to ſuspect a mans own wiſdom and ſeek Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.

            <head>LIB. II.</head>
            <p>IN the former book we have diſcourſed concerning unprofitable queſtions, how they may be diſtinguiſhed from profitable ones, and how they ought to be avoided; it follows now that we ſhould declare what may befit a godly man to do, if it ſhal appear that the buſineſs in Controverſie be a matter of great weight. And here doubtleſs, if thou wilt give eare to <hi>Satan,</hi> he wil endeavour to advance his deſigns exceedingly by thy means. So that, ſome error ſhall not be extirpated, but ſpread abroad far and neer, yea and become as it were the ſeed of many other errors; ſo that contentions, diſcords, variance, ſects, devaſtations, and mighty hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liburlies ſhall thence ariſe; and to the end he wil labour might and main, that no moderate, circumſpect, grave counſel may take place; but that all things be tranſacted raſhly, without advice, confuſedly. What now ſhal a Chriſtian and prudent ſpirit do in this caſe? Shal he think of obeying <hi>Satan</hi> and furthering his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels? Wil he make him his Counſellor and Captain? Wil he not rather with all diligence of mind provide that all things be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the greateſt diſcretion poſſible? So that not a word, as neer as may be, ſhal paſs which is not exactly fitted by reaſon and poliſhed? Wil he not weigh with himſelf again and again what is needful to be done? Here, here indeed is need of prudence, reſiſt the beginnings whiles the flame is yet ſmal, if thou ſhalt let it alone a little while and give fuel to it likewiſe, who ſhal be able to quench the Fire? Theſe things I ſay are to be foreſeen in time. If thou ſhalt hear any impious Doctrine, what thinkeſt thou wil the ſpeech of <hi>Satan</hi> be in thy heart? He wil try <hi>peradventure,</hi> if he can bring the <hi>Error</hi> in credit with thee alſo: but if he find the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:150539:29" rendition="simple:additions"/> doors ſhut on this ſide, and ſhal thee another way; O abominable wickedneſs! (wil he ſay) O this fellow deſerves that the Earth ſhould open its mouth and ſwallow him up quick, that durſt once ſpeak ſuch abhominable words; tis pity he were not burnt with fire from Heaven: The baſeſt and wickedeſt fellow that ever the Earth bare! Is it poſſible that any man ſhould ſo much as once think of ſuch things, much leſs account them true? If thou give way to ſuch thoughts as theſe, what canſt thou do or ſay which wil not occaſion a thouſand miſchiefs? Perſwade thy ſelf, that the Spirit of God is not author of ſuch councels but <hi>Satan.</hi> Such thoughts are not fit to take away the evil, but to increaſe it more and more, and render it uncapable of all cure. Somewhat elſe there is to be done to remedy this evil. And firſt, how knoweſt thou, but that this man haply (what ever he may ſeem to be) is one of Gods elect, whom God indeed hath ſuffered to fall, out of ſome ſecret but moſt wiſe and loving purpoſe of his own, that he may raiſe him again with much more glory? whom did'ſt thou but know to be ſuch an one, could'ſt thou entertain any inhumane thoughts againſt him, who is ordained to the poſſeſſion of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Elect, and to be an inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven, againſt thy brother, againſt a member of Chriſt, againſt a ſervant, yea and a ſon of God? But (thou wilt ſay) by this reaſon the Magiſtrate muſt ſuffer theeves, robbers, cut-throats and other criminal offenders, for as much as all ſuch may be of the number of the elect, ſuch as may in time be reclaimed. I anſwer; a godly and wiſe Magiſtrate when he puniſhes ſuch like offenders, he doth it not to ſatisfie his own hatred, but exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes that office whereunto he is called of God, knowing that he is bound to obey Gods revealed wil whatever his own reaſon may notwithſtanding prompt him unto. Even as <hi>Abraham</hi> was ready at Gods command to offer his moſt beloved and moſt innocent ſon <hi>Iſaac.</hi> And in the mean time he omits no office of humanity towards ſuch as are to be put to death. But thou wilt ſay further: Can the ears then o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that man which loves God hear accurſed ſpeeches againſt God, and be no more moved then if they nothing concerned him? I anſwer and grant, that a man ought to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and vehemently moved in ſuch a caſe, but would not allow that motion to be a raſh head-long zeal, but a zeal guided by the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:150539:30"/> moſt accurate reaſon, not of Satans but of the Spirit of Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting. If thou hadſt a brother or a ſon rather, whom thou excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly lovedſt; thou couldſt not ſee him catch a dangerous fall, but (eſpecially in caſe he were therewith grievouſly wounded) thou wouldſt be much moved, but with what kind of motion or affection? So as to inveigh againſt him with harſh language, to overwhelm him with revilings and reproaches? Yea rather thou wouldſt run to him and raiſe him up as gingerly as thou canſt. Thou wouldſt bid him be of good cheer, and leave nothing undone which might free him from, or at leaſt mitigate his pain. Thou wouldſt ſpare no pains and watch with him whole nights together. And in caſe the anguiſh of his wound ſhal make him froward, thou wilt neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs remit nothing of thy great tenderneſs over him. Such would I have the motion of thy mind to be, to be grieved at the fall of thy brother; to be grieved that God is offended; to be grieved for their ſakes whom he hath miſ-taught ſo a that they are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to loſe their ſalvation. But let the effects of thy griefs be, that thou endeavor with all thy might either wholy to remove or to leſſen the evil; and that thou take heed again and again (as in a buſineſs wherein thou canſt not err without great danger) that thou neither do or ſpeak any thing which may increaſe the ſame, nor of which thou canſt not foreſee ſome certain hope of profit; and that thou wilt ſo order thy ſelf, that in caſe thou ſhalt at any time obſerve, that what thou didſt to a good end had a bad iſſue, thou wilt be content with the hazard of thy reputation to correct thine <hi>Error.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, three things ſeem to require our conſideration: what courſe is to be taken concerning him that ſows <hi>Errors;</hi> what is to be done concerning ſuch as have aſſented unto <hi>Errors;</hi> and what concerning ſuch as are in danger to be infected. Concerning the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Error,</hi> thou muſt be exceeding careful, what end and ſcope all thy counſels aim at. Many weighing what a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive thing <hi>Error</hi> in Religion is, and conſequently what dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage he brings to the <hi>Church of God</hi> who diſperſeth <hi>Errors,</hi> they think nothing can be enacted too ſeverely againſt him. Whereupon at every firſt word they break out into railings and reproaches, and fill the world with out-cries, and a man would wonder how they pleaſe themſelves in ſo doing, and how rarely they conceive they
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:150539:30" rendition="simple:additions"/> have defended the cauſe of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Neither do theſe men much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, whether a man teach falſe out of ignorance, or to ſerve his own luſt. Yea rather as though they were aſſured that never any ſuch thing is done but out of malice, they deal with every one as with a malicious ſeducer. Hence come theſe kind of expreſſions: The filthy beaſt was not aſhamed to ſpeak ſo and ſo. The moſt cunning impoſtor hath left nothing unattempted whereby he might poyſon ſimple people, with the like expreſſions; and a man would wonder to ſee how fluent ſome men are and copious in ſuch kind of Rhetorick. Now if ſo be a man ſhal think that he teacheth true and godly doctrines and that he is wel and holily employed, for this cauſe, by all the reaſons he can he wil endeavor to cauſe his <hi>Errors</hi> to be received and conceive that he deſerves much praiſe for ſo doing. If therefore thou ſhalt fall foul upon him, averring that he deals maliciouſly, impudently and wickedly, he wil think himſelf to be exceedingly injured. Whereupon he wil be moved and inflamed with anger and determine with himſelf to maintain his <hi>Error</hi> come what wil come, and to bandy back the injuries with a large requital. Then wil the people alſo take ſeveral ſides, and all places wil be diſquieted with contentions, ſcoldings, excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations; So that no good, much hurt wil follow. Wherefore, as thy aim ought to be, that he which ſows <hi>Errors</hi> may not eſcape a juſt and deſerved cenſure; ſo oughteſt thou to deal much other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with him that being deceived himſelf deceiveth others, then with him that doth it maliciouſly, and not to puniſh any for malice till that malice appear manifeſt, and it is the part of a wel-diſpoſed mind in a doubtful caſe to incline to the more favorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, ſo as rather to make ſuppoſition of <hi>Error</hi> then malice. Furthermore, thoſe men are wont to incur great hatred and to bring great calamities upon themſelves who labour to broach new Tenets, ſo that he which ſhould take any pleaſure to ſtir up the hate of men againſt himſelf and to make himſelf to be inveighed againſt, muſt be a ſtrange kind of man. Wherefore no man ought to ſuppoſe ſuch a thing of any man, unleſs upon very great probability. And if it be a matter of <hi>Error</hi> and not of malice, verily thus I think, that if there be any thing in which clemency is to be uſed, here it ought to take place. Suppoſe a man fearing God, that look what himſelf accounts true and ſaving doctrine, would fain (if it were
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:150539:31"/> poſſible) that all the world might know and approve the ſame: in ſuch a caſe, if you conſider the mind of the man, wil not any harſh dealing towards him appear to be inhumanity and cruelty. God hath not endowed him with more wit or judgment, neither hath he imparted to him a greater meaſure of his Spirit: if then thou ſhalt be angry with him, thou wilt ſeem to be angry not ſo much with him as with God that hath given him no greater abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Now if ſo be thou look at the iſſue and fruit, nothing is more unprofitable then anger, indignations and invectives full of crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and reproaches. But if ſo be there be knavery in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I ſhal readily grant, no cenſure can be grievous enough, no puniſhment can be invented ſo ſevere, but to be many degrees ſhort of ſo horrible wickedneſs: That there ſhould be any man whom neither the fear of God nor the ſalvation of men could any ways move, but whiles he ſatisfies his own luſt he ſets all at ſix and ſeven. Howbeit, in caſe a man be worthy of great cenſure, it may not be expedient forthwith to deal with him according to his deſerts. <hi>All things</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient.</hi> So that we muſt conſider again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, what is moſt expedient, what regard is to be had of the perſon, what the time, what the place cals for, which things a mind diſturbed with anger or any other paſſion cannot diſcern. For anger darkens a mans ſight, duls, troubles and corrupts the judgment, is the worſt counſellor that can be at all times and in all affairs. Be it that a man deſerve to be ſtoned to death, to be torn in pieces limb from limb, this may be done by the ſentence of the Magiſtrate, without wrath, without inſultation, without railing. For what need is there of theſe affections, the enemies of all ſound judgment? So ſhal it be done with greater gravity and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and the puniſhment wil ſeem to have proceeded not from the luſt of man but from right reaſon it ſelf. So likewiſe ſhal the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of ſuch ſeverity take much ſtronger impreſſion in the minds of men. Now theſe are the things we ought to have a care of, that he which hath ſeduced the people, ſeduce them no more, but may ſuffer truth to take place; that thoſe which have been ſeduced may be brought back again to the truth; that ſuch who are yet ſound may be armed againſt the contagion of <hi>Error.</hi> Whether or no it be alſo requiſite that by ſome fitting puniſhment, as with a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:150539:31" rendition="simple:additions"/> bridle, the daring of <hi>extravagant</hi> wits, ſhould be curbed from blurting out whatever comes into their pates, we ſhal hereafter take into conſideration. It may ſo fall out, that God wils that ſome ſhould be ſharply reproved, that at the laſt day they may have the leſs excuſe and undergo the more ſevere puniſhment: Yet, as no man living can ſay who thoſe perſons be, ſo no man ought to be moved with the conſideration of ſuch; if there be any ſuch whom God would have ſo ſeverely chidden, he wil ſtir up ſuch as ſhal do it, only let us take heed that <hi>Satan</hi> deceive us not, and that we permit not his inſtigations to be obtruded upon us, as if they were the breathings of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Now that thou mayſt know by what means thou mayſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw a malicious ſeducer from ſeducing the people; thou muſt underſtand and conſider, that he which ſhal ſet himſelf to commit ſo great a wickedneſs, muſt be a perſon extraordinarily Impious and void of all fear of God; concerning him therefore, whether pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or abſent, if thou ſhalt ſpeak according to his merit, if thou ſhalt paint him out in his colours, and he forthwith ſhal abſtain, what think you his meaning is? Wil he not ſeem openly to confeſs himſelf guilty of thoſe crimes which thou haſt charged him with? Is it poſſible thou ſhould'ſt promiſe thy ſelf ſo much moderation, ſo much relenting in a man void of the fear of God? Mayſt thou not with much more reaſon expect, that he wil endeavor to clear himſelf of all crimes objected againſt him, and lay many more to thy charge? Wil he not beat his brains night and day to invent ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies wherewith to defame thee? And what is there ſo far from <hi>Truth,</hi> which a craftily-compoſed diſcourſe cannot make to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear probable? And when as Angers and Hatreds ſhal encreaſe here and there, when as daily vehement accuſations ſhal be heard on both ſides, the people ſhal be divided into contrary factions, what ſhalt thou gain thereby, which a man of a ſound judgment would not much repent him of? If then there be any hope (which is very ſmal) to withdraw ſuch a perſon from his enterprize, it doth not herein conſiſt, in diſcovering and laying to his charge his malice; but herein rather, if forbearing to ſpeak of his fraud and malice, thou ſhalt in the firſt place ſo defend the <hi>truth,</hi> and render it ſo clear that it may be almoſt felt: if thou ſhalt do this with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt dexterity and gentleneſs that may be: for as it is hard to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:150539:32"/> from a wicked nefarious perſon, a willingneſs to appear van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed by argument, and to have bin in an <hi>Error;</hi> ſo ſhouldeſt thou fooliſhly hope, that he would be content to have it thought that wittingly and willingly he hath, through exceſs of wickedneſs cheated the people. In like manner, towards the reducing of ſuch as have bin ſeduced, I cannot ſee what good can be wrought by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the Author. For it is commonly ſeen, that he which aſſents to any mans tenets, doth reverence that man and count him worthy of honor and praiſe; ſo that if you ſhal go about to diſgrace him with reproaches, he wil ſay thou doſt him great wrong, and wil be diſpleaſed with thee therefore. Now who knows not that good wil and hatred, and other paſſions of the mind have great power to ſway the judgment this way or that way? Nor can I underſtand of what greater uſe it wil be towards the preſervation of thoſe that are as yet untainted. For its almoſt impoſſible that a ſpeech ful of revilings and accuſations, ſhould not flow from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or ſome vehement motion of mind; now where ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are, its a wonder, if all things be ſaid with due circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and not rather frequent overſights be committed, either by not rightly repeating the Seducers words, or not fitly anſwering his Arguments, whereby (as we have ſhewed) many inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences ariſe. And many men there are who are offended with all bad language, be there juſt cauſe, or be there not, for ſo ſpeaking: and they wil think ill of, and diſaffect that man, in whom they ſee a propenſity to revile. Which, what elſe is it but to be the readier to aſſent unto thoſe whom thou laboreſt, with all thy might, to diſparage with reproaches? Eſpecially if they ſhal have the Art, ſlily and craftily to counterfeit ſome kind of modeſty and patience. I confeſs indeed with ſome, Criminations are of that force, that they cannot hear ſo much as the name of thoſe that are reproached, without trembling; ſo far wil they be from ſuffering themſelves to be by ſuch perſons ſeduced; but this falls out only then for the moſt part, when the perſons criminating are in high repute for their up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs, holyneſs and innocency, ſo that it may ſeem impoſſible that they ſhould be drawn by any means to do injuriouſly towards any; which opinion ſetled in the minds of the people concerning thee, thou maiſt with much more eaſe falſly aſcribe and arrogate, then procure unto thy ſelf. For even we our ſelvs oftentimes do not
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:150539:32" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſufficiently know, by what ſpirit we are led; and be a man never ſo innocent, he ſhal never be able to hinder, but that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things deſigned with all poſſible ſanctity, ſhal be miſ-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by the common people. And thoſe perſons themſelves who by means of crimes alledged, have withdrawn all credit from the parties accuſed, would in all likelyhood have done the like, when they had heard their tenets related, and without crimination, by ſure and certain arguments and teſtimonies, candidly and civilly refuted.</p>
            <p>Hitherto (I conceive) we have cleared, how that from bad language, very many and great evils ariſe, and that the profit from thence ariſing is either none at all or very little, and that it may more certainly by other ways be attained. It remains only that we ſpeak of that ſame reaſon which is alleadged, why ſuch language ſhould be uſed, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe by ſuch kind of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, the Authors of new tenets are curbed. And in the firſt place I deſire it may be noted, that we do not in this place treat of the office of the Magiſtrate; it is the duty of private men which we handle in this place, and of ſuch to whoſe care the inſtruction of the people in piety is committed. Concerning the Magiſtrate we ſhal ſpeak hereafter. Now then, foraſmuch as it is not in the power of any one, ſave the Magiſtrate, to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or puniſh malefactors; other men muſt take heed they put not their ſickle into that field which belongs not to them. There is to this purpoſe, an excellent paſſage of <hi>Cicero</hi> in his fourth book of Common-wealths: Our twelve tables (quoth he) contrariwiſe, enacting very few faults puniſhable by Death, made this for one; if by any practiſing or libelling a man ſhould defame any one, or charge him with any heynous offence. A gallant law! foraſmuch as the lives and converſations of men, ought to be ſubject to the Law, and the legal deciſions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of Magiſtrates, not to the wits of Poets and pamphle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; neither ought any thing to be reproachfully charged upon any one, ſave with condition, that he may have liberty to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer and make his defence in open Court. Is a mans reputation ſo ſlight a matter, that it ſhould he open to every bodies luſt? If the ſupreme Magiſtrate of the Common wealth ſhould ſet himſelf to diſgrace and defame whomſoever he pleaſed (though
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:150539:33"/> there might be reaſon enough ſo to do) without proceſs of law, who would not ſay he plaid the part of a Tyrant rather then a King? That therefore which the chief Magiſtrate cannot do but by manifeſt tyranny, ſhal any private man be ſuffered to do the ſame, ſhal it be permitted to him to do it, whoſe office it is, not ſo much by words as his own example to train the people in all Honeſty and Moderation of mind? It is indeed the part of a Paſtor, to reprehend, to chide, to rebuke, but he ought to do it not as an enemy, but as a father; ſo far forth as may be neceſſary and profitable for the amendment of thoſe he hath to deal with. And he ought to remember, that it is not his, but the Magiſtrates office to cenſure or puniſh any one. And in caſe he ſhal plead that it belongs to him; let us conſider with what ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs he ſhal uſe ſuch a power in reſpect of the end propoſed. I ſhal not deny, but that many men, terrified by the example of ſuch perſons as they ſee by ſuch dealing, brought into great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and hatred, may become thereby leſs, daring to vent ſuch things, as curious ſtudies frequently ſuggeſt: howbeit, unleſs the lives of ſuch who are the Cenſurers, be void not only of vice but ſuſpition too, and unleſs their holyneſs and innocency be in all things apparent, ſo that they ſhal rather ſhew themſelves to be certain divine creatures then of Mankind; I conceive they ſhal advance very little by ſuch a courſe. For it wil juſt ſo fall out, as when a man ſhal ſtop the paſſage of a river with damms: the waters wil ſeem for a while to be reſtrained of their courſe, yet wil they ſeek a paſſage on all ſides, and to be ſure, ſwelling higher and higher, they wil overflow the bay, and at length ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving eate through and throwndown the damms, with mighty vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence wil they break forth, and make, by many degrees, greater waſte, then if their courſe had never bin reſtrained: for the man whoſe liberty is curbed by ſuch a bridle, for a time indeed he keeps himſelf quiet, but it is much againſt his wil, and he collects poyſon by little and little, wherewith being filled he muſt of neceſſity pour it forth, and it proves ſo much the more deadly, by how much the longer he kept it in: foraſmuch as hatred againſt ſuch as he conceives tyrannically to rule over him, is the cauſe, that, he is averſe unto, and abhorrs their opinions. Hereupon he endeavors by all the cunning ways poſſible, firſt,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:150539:33" rendition="simple:additions"/> to draw away, now one, then another to his ſide; and ſo the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil grows by little and little and gathers ſtrength, til at length the ſect fears not to diſcover it ſelf, and to diſquiet the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; which is plainly ſeen, among many other inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in the ſo late ſedition at <hi>Munster.</hi> And a wonderful thing it is, with what arts <hi>Satan</hi> furniſhes theſe kind of men, and with what ſucceſs he furthers their deſigns: which if thoſe men would more adviſedly weigh, who judg reproaches to be of ſuch force to preſerve the purity of doctrine, they would, haply, be leſs delighted with them then they are. In a word, as I deny not, but that ſometime, ſharp reproofs ought to take place, ſo I Avouch, that all thoſe conditions do very ſeldom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr which are requiſite, that they may be in the leaſt meaſure beneficial. And to paſs over the conſideration of their profit, a great and wonderful is that, which <hi>Jude</hi> in his Epiſtle mentions, that <hi>Michael</hi> the <hi>Archangel</hi> contending about the body of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> durſt not rail upon <hi>Satan</hi> himſelf, but deſired God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke him. What hare-braind men are we! how much greater things dare we not only againſt <hi>Satan</hi> (which yet were a great arrogance, to take more liberty then the <hi>Archangel</hi> thought fit to uſe) but againſt men, it may be no leſs dear to God then we our ſelves are. Would we but weigh this one example, and then conſider, what liberty we uſe in mutual reproaches; verily, that man muſt be very blind, that ſees not, how that this ſame cuſtom of evil-ſpeaking comes from no other ſpirit, but that of the Divel. But, foraſmuch as we have declared, that what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we do upon the report of ſome Error ſpread abroad, we ought to conſider the end we ought to aime at in every thing, and that we ought among other things, to endeavor that the party erring may be drawn from his Error; to which purpoſe bad language and inſultations profit not, but rather do very much hurt; let us now make enquiry, what is moſt fit to be done in ſuch a caſe.</p>
            <p>Now there are two things requiſite to reduce a perſon erring from his Error; firſt, ſuch demonſtrations as may be of force with one of his judgment, to diſcover his error unto him; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that he may weigh ſuch demonſtrations with a perfect and ſound judgment. But if ſo be the demonſtrations ſhal not
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:150539:34"/> be ſuited to a mans underſtanding, or he ſhal not weigh them, or in caſe he do, it ſhal be with a prejudiced and corrupted judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we ſhal miſs of our intended ſcope. Further, his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhal then become ſound and uncorrupt, when God ſhal have healed it with his ſpirit, and have rendred it capable of the truth; as alſo when it is not vexed with any jealouſies or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Here therefore nothing is more to be avoided, then that we ſpeak or do any thing which may wound his mind and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrange his affections; ſuch are all words that may imply our bearing any ill-wil towards him, ſuch as may gall and accuſe him of deceit, ignorance, impudence; or, in a word, any ways blaſt his reputation. We ought rather by all kind of humanity and reſpects, invite him to gentleneſs, moderation and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wil; whereunto charity wil beſt inſtruct us, provided it be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, void of oſtentation; which vertue whoſoever is not aſſured that he is furniſhed with, let him not once meddle in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign til he have attained it. And if ſo be thou canſt ſee nothing in the party that may deſerve thy love, conſider what there is in God and his only begotten ſon, whoſe workmanſhip he is, that may command thy affection. Were it not the pleaſure of God that this man ſhould live, either he ſhould never have bin born, or preſently expired upon his birth, or at leaſt never have lived til this time: whereas now thou ſeeſt how God nouriſhes him, how he cauſes his ſun to ſhine upon him as much as upon thy ſelf, and how thouſands of ways he makes him partaker of his liberallity and goodneſs. Shal it then become thee who art the ſervant of this God, to be otherwiſe affected towards ſuch an one? How knoweſt thou (as we ſaid before) but this man may be a ſheep of the Lords fold, which, how ever at preſent he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from the flock as one diſtracted, ſhal at length be found by that beſt of the ſhepherds, healed &amp; brought back to the flock? And if the caſe be ſuch, doeſt thou not diſcern our Lord himſelf, in the perſon of ſuch an one, coming to the weak and ſick to make tryal of thy love, which he intends to commemorate at the laſt day? And foraſmuch as thou art not able to judg whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be thus or no, it is enough for thee, that poſſibly he may be ſuch an one; ſo that what ever kindneſs thou ſhalt ſhew him, the Lord may reckon it as done unto himſelf. Thou oughteſt
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:150539:34" rendition="simple:additions"/> not therefore to look upon his perſon, but upon the perſon of Chriſt whom he repreſents, and to remember how great his love hath bin to thee: inſomuch as he refuſed not, being himſelf juſt and innocent, to dye for thee an unjuſt perſon, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of ſinners, eſpecially by ſo cruel and bloody a death. Oh, had we but the leaſt ſuſpition concerning any man, that he ſhould hereafter be a King, yea the beſt of Kings; ſuppoſe his preſent condition to be never ſo mean and obſcure, how far would we be from contemning ſuch a man? And what I pray you, is the dignity and ſoveraignty of a King, compared with that dgnity and luſtre which is laid up for Gods elect? And ſhal we account that man unworthy of our humanity and good wil, who, for ought we know, is born to this glory? Again, it wil be very effectual to move thee to a gentle opinion concerning ſuch a man, if entring into thine own heart, thou ſhalt take a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and ſtrict ſurvey of all thy actions, of thy whole life and cogitations, and examine them by the Law of God. And if ſo be thou ſhalt find thy ſelf tainted in the preſence of God with many and great ſins, and yet doſt comfort thy ſelf, that he wil not deal ſeverely with thee, nor puniſh thee according to thy deſerts, but rather carry himſelf towards thee, as a tender God and Father: why mayſt thou not hope, that he ſhal be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the like gentleneſs? And ſince, in regard of this hope of thine, thou lookeſt upon thy ſelf, as one no ways to be deſpiſed; what reaſon is there, thou ſhouldeſt not judg the ſame of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Further, with ſuch meditations as theſe, we muſt ioyn frequent and fervent prayers to God, that he would ſoften our heart, and would plant therein, with his own hand, a true and living charity, which wil direct us unto ſuch apt and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ways of dealing with our brother, that it wil be a miracle if we do not ſhortly reclaim him. And whereas no man can underſtand the things of God but by the ſpirit of God; before we begin any diſpute, let us wraſtle with God by prayer, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to our aſſiſtance ſome other godly perſons, that he by his ſpirit would be preſent with the perſon erring, and open his heart and eyes, that he may acknowledg the truth; yea, and we ought to exhort him to make the like prayer to God in his own behalf.</p>
            <pb n="48" facs="tcp:150539:35"/>
            <p>As for demonſtrations, they wil be then available to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the truth, when God is their Author, as it is writen; <hi>I wil inſtruct you with ſuch a tongue and ſuch wiſdom, that no body ſhal be able to reſiſt you.</hi> And again, <hi>as the rain and ſnow deſcend from heaven, and return not thither again, but do moiſten and ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the earth, making it to bud, and bring forth, and yeeld bread to ſuſtain the life of man; ſo my word that proceeds out of my mouth, ſhal not return to me fruitleſs, but ſhal accompliſh all my will, &amp; shal proſper towards thoſe to whom I shal ſend it.</hi> Here then we ſee that prayers are again neceſſary unto the Lord, that he would not only open the heart of the perſon erring, but alſo ſuggeſt unto us ſuch words as maybe moſt fitting to demonſtrate the truth. And if it ſhal not ſeem abſurd to allow ſome place for ſuch arts, which though they be termed humane; yet if a man ſhal no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ways uſe them, then as knowing that while he plants and waters, it muſt be God that can give the encreaſe, and putting all his confidence in him; no man can deny but they are the gifts of God: I ſhal further add, that thoſe demonſtrations have power to perſwade, which taking their riſe from things evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently known, and from ſuch places of Scripture as are moſt clear and uncapable of different interpretations, in a due order, and with a perpetual connexion; no medium being overpaſt or miſplaced, do arrive unto the point in controverſie; or elſe which ſhal begin at the Tenet to be diſproved, and ſome other point out of all queſtion, inferring by degrees, until ſuch time as the party erring ſhal be brought to ſome great abſurdity; which when by no means it can be maintained, it is impoſſible but the party dealt with ſhal confeſs; that ſomewhat untrue hath bin laid down, eſpecially if this ſhal be done with words and expreſſions, noways obſcure, doubtful, or intricate, but plain, clear and familiar. Howbeit (to ſay the truth) few there are, that can thus do, and the reaſon is, becauſe there are very few, that had not far rather be writers and ſpeakers then Meditators. Now it is not enough, if the argument which thou ſhalt bring, ſhalt ſeem unto thee to the purpoſe, but it ought to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to the wit and judgment of him that is to be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded therewith. As for example: if thou haply ſhalt ſo prize the Authority of <hi>Origen,</hi> as to think thou oughteſt to credit
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:150539:35" rendition="simple:additions"/> what ever he ſays, and ſhalt alleadg ſome place of his writings wherein he ſeems to take thy part, this may ſeem to thee, to make much on thy ſide; but if he with whom thou haſt to deal, ſhal give little or no credit to <hi>Origen,</hi> this Teſtimony wil ſtand thee in no ſtead, and as little ſhalt thou prevail, if having to deal with a <hi>Turk</hi> or ſome other enemy to Chriſtianity, thou ſhalt make uſe of Teſtimonies of Scripture. Thus likewiſe it will come to paſs, if dealing with reaſons, thou ſhalt take ſuch things for grant, which, howbeit to thee they ſeem out of queſtion, yet thy Adverſary is not perſwaded of their truth. For thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to aſſume ſuch things as are true, not only in thine own, but in his account alſo. As if thou ſhalt ſay, we muſt not confeſs our ſins to a Prieſt, becauſe God hath not commanded it; and there ſtop: for he which doth not as yet know, or at leaſt for the preſent remembers not, that we ought to obſerve nothing but what God himſelf ſhal command, wil not a whit be moved with that reaſon. There is a like, but more obſcure paſſage in <hi>Tullies</hi> book called <hi>Laelius;</hi> the words are theſe. <hi>Scipio denied that any ſpeech could be more contrary to friendſhip, then his that ſaid, a man ought ſo to love, as remembring that he may hate where he loves; neither could he perſwade himſelf, that (as it is belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)</hi> Bias <hi>ſhould utter any ſuch thing, who was accounted one of the ſeven wiſe men, but that it came from ſome baſe ambitious ſpirit, from a man that would reduce all things to his own power. For how is it poſſible any man ſhould be his friend, to whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives he may become an enemy? Yea, he muſt of neceſſity deſire and wiſh that his friend may frequently offend; that he may give him the more occaſions to reprehend him. Again, he muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be vexed, greived and moved to envy, by the wel-doing and profit of his friends.</hi> So far <hi>Loelius.</hi> Now a man wil wonder how theſe abſurdities ſhould follow from the ſpeech of <hi>Bias;</hi> whereas haply had the Argumentation bin compleat, all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mervail would have bin taken away. And that thou mayſt underſtand, what the way of prevailing in this caſe is, what reaſons wil move thine Adverſary, and what not, thou muſt be very wel acquainted with what he ſays and thinks; as alſo (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Controverſie in hand) what other opinions he holds, what thoſe things be whereof he is moſt certainly perſwaded,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:150539:36"/> and what his judgmnet is. Now there is nothing ſo uſual in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, as for to cavil at one anothers words, and to collect ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities. Whence, for the moſt part, it comes to paſs, that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is made, no: ſo much againſt what is affirmed, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt what thou by a falſe interpretation haſt feigned to thy ſelf. Which kind of practiſe whereunto can it tend, but (as we have ſaid) to provoke thine adverſary to choler, to confirm his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and peremptoryneſs; and to open to thy ſelf a window whereout to caſt a thouſand follies, not a jot to the matter in hand? Thus to do, is to imitate unskilful phyſitians, who little examine the nature of the diſeaſe; appoint remydies, nothing to the purpoſe, and in ſtead of curing kil their Patients. Yet ſome men are exceedingly conceited of themſelves, if miſ-interpreting their adverſaries words, they can infer ſome great abſurdity therefrom. Howbeit, this cuſtom ought to be left to vain <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſters.</hi> In matters of this nature, of ſuch weight and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, let it not be thy aime, that thou mayſt ſeem to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed the error by hook or by crook, on any faſhion; but let thy endeavour be to confute it indeed, and in truth, ſo as thine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary may not have a word to ſay for himſelf, which thou ſhalt never accompliſh unleſs thou give diligent heed, rightly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thine oppoſites words. And if ſo be he ſeem to utter ſomewhat that is very abſurd, thou oughteſt to be the more fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, leaſt thou miſ-underſtand him, and rather to deſire him to explain his meaning; then to fall upon the bones of the abſurdity, when thou art not yet certain, that it is thine adverſaries mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. And when the controverſie is managed face to face, herein commonly is the grand miſcarriage, that a man perſwades himſelf he can at the firſt word, divine what his adverſary would ſay, before he hear him out, and would be preſently at the Anſwer: whence it comes to paſs that clamours are raiſed, choler is moved, and all the labour is loſt. Away then with this raſh forecaſting, and let us ſtay til our time come to Anſwer. Others when they have produced an Argument, wil needs tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph before the Victory, not able to ſtay til the other reply. Becauſe they can ſee no way to avoid the dint of their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they think ſurely, no body elſe can. Out upon ſuch light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! we cannot every man know all things. For ſuppoſing thou
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:150539:36" rendition="simple:additions"/> knoweſt more then I in all other matters, what wonder is it, if I haply know more then thou in this one point? What ſhalt thou get by this thine eagerneſs, ſaving to lay naked, like a fool, thine own Arrogance, Inſolence and crabbed condition? If in worldly matters, Experience hath taught this proverbial Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>

               </q> what ſhal we think in matters divine, of which the truth it ſelf thus ſpeaks; <hi>That it hath pleaſed his heavenly father, to hide his ſecrets from the wiſe, and to reveal them to babes and ſucking Children?</hi> Now we find by experience, that if thine adverſary obſerve that thou underſtandeſt his meaning, what he holds, and by what reaſons he is induced ſo to think, and ſhal ſee thee not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, ready to contradict and oppoſe him; it wil be almoſt impoſſible, but he wil abate much of his confidence. He was formerly perſwaded, that in caſe his fancies were rightly underſtood, every one would aſſent unto them; but now when he ſees him that underſtands them, refuſing to give his aſſent, he cannot chuſe, but wonder. Which what elſe is it, but to make ſome kind of doubt, leaſt his Tenets be not ſo ſound as they ought to be? Hereupon likewiſe he is inflamed with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know what it is thou haſt to object, which deſire hath made him fit to underſtand thee, and being come ſo far, the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is wel-near accompliſhed. My judgment therefore is in overthrowing an Error, that the chief labour ought to be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to underſtand what is affirmed, according to the meaning of him that ſpake the words; not how thou by a crafty cavill mayſt interpret the ſpeech: yea rather, if any violence ſhould be offered to the words, I would much rather they ſhould be drawn to ſerve the purpoſe of the ſpeaker, then to any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Among other faults committed by miſ-underſtanding our adverſaries words; this is a frequent one, when we thus rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with our ſelves; if it were as that man affirms, this and that would thereof follow, and then look what inferences we make in our own underſtandings, we attribute them unto our
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:150539:37"/> Adverſaries, and waſte away the time in confuting ſuch things, as they peradventure never once ſo much as thought of, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we do both provoke them, and render our ſelves ridiculous; which the better to underſtand, this example may be of uſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Papiſts ſay, that ſins committed after baptiſm, muſt either be expiated with good works by us wrought, or after death, by the fire of Purgatory; if we ſhal thus infer; If it be neceſſary that any ſins be expiated, either by our doings or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, then Chriſt hath not taken them away, and then he hath not performed what he came into the world for, <hi>viz.</hi> to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the works of the Divel, and therefore ſhal ſay that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts deny that Chriſt did that he came into the world to do: we ſhal ſo far ſay true, inaſmuch as they do in ſome ſort deny that Chriſt hath done, what he came into the world for, becauſe it follows from what they hold; yet ſhal not our ſaying be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually true, inaſmuch as they do not expreſly ſay ſo, and it may be, think not ſo neither. So that if we ſhal proceed with many words to blame them for ſuch collections, as if they were their poſitions, they wil ſay that we are mad. What ſhal we do then in this Caſe? Report what they ſay without addition, diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or alteration. And if ſo be abſurdities ſhal follow from their words, they are to be collected only to this end, that it may appear, that what they hold is falſe. Such ingenuity is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable what ever thing be controverted; as for the Diſciples of Chriſt reaſoning about matters Divine, no ornament in the world can more become them.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Deſire of Conqueſt ought to be baniſhed from all Chriſtian diſputes: let all thy care be, that truth may overcome; neither let it concern thee, whether ſhe be diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by thee or ſome other man; perſwade thy ſelf that thy repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſhal be ſufficiently provided for, in caſe God may have that honour which is due to him; which is much advanced, when Truth is reſcued and vindicated from Impoſture. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in caſe it fall out, that by means of the diſpute, thou come to know that thou waſt ignorant of before, beware thou ſhame not to acknowledg it; never care who it is thou muſt give way unto. Know thou, that it is a moſt honourable thing to be taught of God, be it by what inſtrument ſoever. Let them be
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:150539:37" rendition="simple:additions"/> aſhamed that wil not learn. If thou art aſhamed of him, whom God ſhal uſe as his inſtrument, aſſure thy ſelf, it is not man but God whom thou contemneſt, whoſe ſevere vengeance thou ſhalt not eſcape, unleſs with a reverent mind thou embrace his prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered favour. And to the end thou mayſt do this the more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>caſion ſhal require, it wil be much to the purpoſe, if thou ſhalt avoid ſuch things as encreaſe the difficulty to practiſe the ſame; ſuch as theſe: to averr any thing with great confidence, ſo as often to proteſt that thou wilt account it a great offence, an heinous crime, yea meer madneſs for any man to contradict thee; to call him a block that cannot underſtand it, and the like. For it wil afterward ſeem very grievous, to appear to have ſhot ſo wide of the mark; ſo that it is far better to ſpeak warily at all times, not ſo as to ſeem always to doubt (for that were not commendable) but barely to affirm what thou conceiveſt to be the truth, and in like manner to deny ſuch things, as thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveſt to be falſe, and to alleadg Arguments and Teſtimonies, on the one ſide or on the other: only abſtain from ſuch expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as theſe; what an impious thing is this? What raſhneſs? What impudence to affirm ſo or ſo, and the like. The <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matitians</hi> uſe moſt ſure demonſtrations and infallible, yet ſhal you never hear them utter ſuch a word; for ſuch ſpeeches add nothing to the certainty and clearneſs of the demonſtrations. If it may be free for us to aſſent unto the Truth, when ever it ſhal be made known unto us, and to imbrace a more true opinion, then what for the preſent we hold, why ſhould we by means of ſuch raſh ſpeeches bind our ſelves, as it were by a Law, with great obſtinacy to adhere unto a falſe one? Pertinent hereunto ſeems that advice of <hi>Solomon.</hi> Take heed thou intangle not thy ſelf in contention, leaſt proving over weak thou be aſhamed, and at a <hi>non-plus.</hi> And foraſmuch as we cannot know what things thoſe are wherein we err, that in ſpeaking of them our diſcourſe may be circumſpect, as it ought to be in ſuch matters, we ſhal never uſe this caution when there is need, unleſs we ſhal accuſtom our ſelves, what ever matter we reaſon about, to avoid ſuch kind of expreſsions, as moſt dangerous rocks. Again, the aforeſaid difficulty is much increaſed, if we ſhal greatly deſpiſe our Adverſary; ſo that it wil be much more civil and diſcreet,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:150539:38"/> with whomſoever we have to deal, to contain our ſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bounds of modeſty; and to abſtain from all ſignification of contempt. And foraſmuch, as do what we can, we ſhal hardly obtain the power, to ſeem vanquiſhed without great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctation, we ought to arm our minds againſt this aſſault, as firmly as we can, with ſome prevalent reaſon, by frequent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, deeply imprinted in our mind; nor do I know any more forcible then this; to call to mind, that this whole life, of ours, laſts but for a moment, being like a ſtage-play, where Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Kings, Serving-men, Ladies, Waiting-women are brought upon the ſtage; when the play is done, the players caſting aſide thoſe perſons they acted, are either all equals; or he peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which was King of the play, is now of a more baſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then he that plaid the part of a ſervant. Now in caſe ſome one of the players ſhould find himſelf much agrieved to act that part which ſeems diſhonourable, and had rather offend him, by whoſe favour he ſhal be raiſed out of the duſt, and by whoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure he ſhal become miſerable all his life time; wil not all men account him out of his wits, who ſhal prize more the vain oſtentation of an houre, then ſo many commodities of life? And is there not here the ſame or far greater madneſs? Be thou the Conqueror or Conquered, how long wil the glory or the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace endure? And in caſe thou ſhalt wittingly oppoſe the Truth, and by ſo doing ſhalt make God thine Enemy, what wil become of thee, wretched man that thou art? By thy obſtinacy it may fall out, that the Truth ſhal remain oppreſſed, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable company of people by this means periſh; which wil be ſo many accuſers againſt thee at the laſt day. Who would not tremble every joynt to think of this? Away then with all ſuch kind of peremptorineſs, and let every man reſolve with himſelf, to make no account of his own reputation in this caſe, but to make it his whole deſire that in all diſputes Chriſt may have the better: neither let him care to become the off-ſcouring of the world, ſo that in all things the name of God may be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured. Thou art netled perhaps, that he ſhould get the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, whom peradventure thou didſt ere while lightly eſteem in compariſon of thy ſelf. And is it ſo indeed? Haſt not thou another much greater combat with <hi>Satan?</hi> He hath ſingled thee out,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:150539:38" rendition="simple:additions"/> as it were a certain Fort, which by all engines and endeavours he wil endeavour to Conquer: and thou ſtandeſt upon thy guard. Now if ſo be thou ſhalt oppoſe the Truth known, through the pride of thy mind; Shalt thou not diſhonourably ſurrender thy ſelf unto thine enemy, to ſuch an enemy? Shalt thou not betray thy Fort: And this in the ſight of thy general, from whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is hid? Is there nothing in this caſe, that may vex and afflict thy mind? Conſider again and again the choyce thou art put unto. There is a double fight in which thou art ingaged, thou canſt not in both be Conqueror. If thou art reſolved to become victor on that ſide, by the oppreſſion of Truth, moſt ſure it is, thou ſhalt be overcome in this other duel with <hi>Satan.</hi> But if ſo be thou canſt not be content to be vanquiſhed here, of neceſſity thou muſt ſtrike ſail, and ſubmit thy ſelf in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Which, that thou mayſt do with a more contented mind, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with thy ſelf, that thy giving way, wil not ſeem ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to others, as it doth unto thy ſelf: for who knows not, that nothing is more proper to mankind then to err? And that in every Controverſy it is expected, that the one ſide wil be vanquiſhed? So that it wil not be much wondered at, if thou ſhalt be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come rather then thy adverſary: and though it be a diſgrace to be vanquiſhed, yet is it a thing very praiſe-worthy, and that which is apt to procure great good wil from all good perſons, if thou ſhalt be ſo ingenious, as willingly to give place to the Truth, being once manifeſted. So that in caſe any loſs be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained in reſpect of thy fame and reputation, in point of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it ſhal be abundantly recompenced with the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy goodneſs; which thou mayſt eaſily underſtand to be of more worth of the two; foraſmuch as every man abhorrs a wicked perſon, how learned ſoever he ſeems to be; whereas all men account a good man, though void of all learning, worthy both of Love and Honour. Neither oughteſt thou to perſwade thy ſelf, that it wil not be known thou art vanquiſhed, unleſs thou thy ſelf give ground: yea rather, by how much the more thou ſhalt ſtruggle, by ſo much the more wilt thou diſcover thy ſtifneckedneſs and baſeneſs, and give thine adverſary the more oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to publiſh the ſame, and give the more occaſion to many ſpeeches, which wil not make much for thy reputation. So that

If thou ſhalt frequently meditate on ſuch things as theſe; it wil be a miracle if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred impotency of thy mind be not much abated; So as thou ſhalt be able to ſuffer the Truth to overcome, with a contented mind, when occ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Moreover, he wil whet his mind to the combat, and reſolve either to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh his adverſary, or valiantly to loſe his life.

How that <hi>Satans</hi> aime is from one contention to raiſe infinite, to enflame mens minds with wrath, to rend the Church into Sects, to ſtirr up ſeditions, and erect Tyrannies: in a word that he aimes at nothing but mighty combuſtions and devaſtations.

By no means in the world: but by how much the more eagerly and fiercely he ſets upon thee, by ſo much the more do thou call thy wits about thee, and buckle thy ſelf to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Which thou oughteſt to do with the more alacrity, foraſmuch as the <hi>Apoſtle James</hi> gives us moſt certain hope of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory; where he ſays, <hi>if we ſhal reſiſt the Divel, he wil fly from us.</hi> Oh that this one thing were wel rooted in our minds, that what ever Controverſie be agitated, we have not to do with him that moves it, and that the Controverſie is not about one point of Religion, but that thereby <hi>Satan</hi> ſeeks occaſion to raiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, ſects, brawles, combuſtions, and the ſubverſion of the Kingdom of Chriſt, of the Common-wealth of Chriſtians. Of what force would this one conſideration be towards the mollifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our minds, and the compoſing us more and more to gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and a quiet and circumſpect manner of diſputation! Now among other things which make a diſputant very froward, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance challenges the firſt place, if thou ſhalt think thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt all things, and contemn every body elſe in compariſon of thy ſelf. Which humour is often augmented by wealth, Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, great benefices, reputation, and other things of like Nature. With which perſwaſion, if thy mind ſhal be beſotted, thou
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:150539:40"/> ſhalt not be able to ſuffer any man to ſpeak one whole ſentence, ere his mouth be wel open; thou wilt ſuppoſe thou ſufficiently underſtandeſt what he was about to ſay, and what he might have further added. And with one word, with one word ſay I? Yea rather with one laugh, one wry look, one geſture or other, thou wilt imagine thou haſt abundantly confuted him: and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou ſhalt affirm or deny, if any one ſhal be ſo hardy, as to mutter any thing to the contrary, he ſhal be accounted guilty of high Treaſon and Sacriledg. Thy Adverſary in the mean time, wil be ſo far from being reclaimed from his Error, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto great indignation wil be joyned, and a firm purpoſe to maintain his Tenets with whomſoever he can, ſince he cannot in thy preſence; and if he may not openly, at leaſt privily, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge them far and near: which diſeaſe is exceeding hard to be prevented. For as any man is high in Authority, and ſpeaks from a more elevated place, he conceives he ought to ſeem in like manner wiſer then others, and would commonly, that his Authority ſhould ſerve in ſtead of Reaſon. Howbeit, we muſt oppoſe this miſchief, from whence almoſt infinite evils ariſe, and they very deſtructive. And firſt of all, thou muſt often think, how ſilly a thing it is, if either thou wallow in wealth, from thy riches; if thou art a Magiſtrate from thy Magiſtracy; if thou haſt Benefice from thy Living; or if thou art a Gentleman from thy Gentility, to Arrogate unto thy ſelf any wiſdom or knowledg. Of what kin is wiſdom to any of theſe things? The whole world wil tel thee, that unleſs thou haſt Wit, unleſs thou haſt had Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, unleſs thou haſt undergone long and diligent pains, thoſe things cannot avail thee. And for reputation, what is it but the Teſtimony of the Multitude? A goodly witneſs of thy ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which ſometimes it ſelf, is little leſs then ſtark mad! But if thou wilt give eare to him that only cannot deceive, nor be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, thou wilt find neither wit nor ſtudy, nor teachers to be any thing, but that all reſts in the Spirit of God alone. So that if he only ſhal afford thee plentiful aſſiſtance, though thou ſhalt have no help beſides, thou canſt not but be exactly wiſe; if he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ſhal be wanting, thou canſt not chuſe but be an Arrant fool, however furniſhed with abundance of all other aſſiſtance. Why then ſhould theſe empty names blow thee up? Verily, inaſmuch
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:150539:40" rendition="simple:additions"/> as nature without any external aſſiſtance, flatters every man more then enough, and makes him think himſelf very wiſe, we muſt take heed, leaſt that by a fooliſh relying upon ſuch things, our natural infirmity be encreaſed. And whereas if we conſider the other faults of mans nature, we ſhal find them all to be deep-rooted, and hard to be, I wil not ſay rooted up, but even in part lopped off, and diminiſhed. I am yet of opinion, that if Arrogance be compared with the reſt, they wil appear to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry looſe, and removeable in compariſon; for if thou ſhalt be inflamed with anger, if thou conceive hatred, if thou ſteal, if thou kil; thou canſt not but know that thou committeſt theſe crimes: ſo that if thou ſhalt often commit ſuch acts, thou canſt not but know, that thy mind is inclined to hatred, theft, blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; and mayſt try the maſtery with thy ſelf, and by little and little, endeavour to attain to better diſpoſitions and manners: but in caſe thou ſhalt be poſſeſſed with too great a conceit of thine own wiſdom, it wil be as hard for thee to be perſwaded, that thou doeſt ſo err. For if in any point thou ſhalt err, it wil be as hard a thing while thou erreſt, to make thee underſtand that thou doſt err, as to make thee live and not to live, at one and the ſame inſtant; for to err, and to acknowledg thine Error, were the ſame, as to err, and not to err. It may come to paſs indeed, that after thou haſt remained for a time in thine Error, thou mayſt repent and acknowledg the ſame. But God knows how few Errors come to be acknowledged by thoſe that err. And concerning thoſe few Errors which we acknowledg, that ſelf-love which is bred in our bone, is never wanting of an excuſe; ſo that every man wil lay the fault any where, rather then in his own judgment, whence it comes to paſs, that he cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern how he Arrogates unto himſelf, more then is meet: and foraſmuch as the diſeaſe is hidden, the medicine is not ſo much as ſought after. And truly in this caſe, I cannot ſee what other way any good is to be done, but by that courſe we formerly mentioned, which, becauſe it ought to be deeply imprinted in our minds, it muſt not ſeem irkſome to make repetition thereof in this place: And that was this. Since we ſee, that all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of mans life are ful of diſſentions, in things divine and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, publique and private, in peace and war, at home and abroad,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:150539:41"/> and yet there is but one Truth in all things; of neceſſity, very many muſt err. And foraſmuch as for the moſt part, thoſe that are judged to excel others in wiſdom, are at difference among themſelves; it muſt be concluded, that many alſo of thoſe that are accounted wiſe, do err. And inaſmuch as one man errs in one thing, another in another, and therefore thoſe things in which every man errs, muſt needs be many; and becauſe none ſo excels in wiſdom, but he may be ſubject to humane frailty, when he leaſt ſuſpects himſelf; Reaſon thus with thy ſelf; all other men err, and that frequently; and it cannot betide a very wiſe man of exact judgment to err often: there is not therefore, a man who hath attained to ſo great wiſdom, but that he comes far ſhort of the top, and yet there is no man but at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ributes very much unto himſelf, and in ſo doing, is exceedingly miſtaken in his opinion. What therefore wilt thou judg of thy ſelf? Wilt thou not thus think? I am a man too; that therefore which is ſo proper to man, muſt of neceſſity be in mee too, though I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it not, that ſo thou mayſt labour to weaken the force of thine Arrogance. But there is in man a kind, of I know not what ſpirit, an egregious flatterer, and very crafty, which in the midſt of ſuch meditations as theſe, mutters I know not what in his heart, which he doth in ſuch a manner, as that his ſpeech is more moving, affecting, and intoxicating, then diſcernable. Yet if thou canſt reach his meaning, thou ſhalt find he ſpeaks to this effect: true indeed it is, there is no man but is deceived in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing too much unto himſelf, howbeit this Arrogance is far from thee, thy caſe is far different, who art led by a ſpecial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, which wil not ſuffer thee to miſtake in judging. And ſo great is the force of this inchantment, that though thou ſhalt ſtrive long and earneſtly with thy ſelf, yet ſhalt thou hardly be able to lay down any little portion of this vain perſwaſion. But of this thou oughteſt to be certainly perſwaded, that by how much the leſs thou ſuſpecteſt thy ſelt of Arrogance, by ſo much the more Arrogant thou art, for whilſt thou thinkeſt wel of thy ſelf, the wiſe King <hi>Solomon</hi> reckons thee amongſt the number of fools. <hi>A fool</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is pleaſed with his own reaſonings, but a wiſe man ſeeks Councel.</hi> So that the top of humane wiſdom ſeems to be, for a man to ſuſpect his own wiſdom, and to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:150539:41" rendition="simple:additions"/> know that he ſtands in need of the Counſel of another. Which Text verily ought continually to be oppoſed againſt that moſt wicked ſpirit, that he may not eſtrange thy mind from mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty.</p>
            <p>And that thou mayſt the better underſtand, that modeſty is altogether neceſſary in diſputes; I wil add one thing, which at the firſt view, may ſeem very abſurd, though nothing in the world is more certainly true: whoſoever thou art, thou canſt not maintain a Controverſie with any man about any point, but that, look by how much thou thinkeſt thy ſelf wiſer then hee, by ſo much on the other ſide, will he think himſelf to be wiſer then thou. The reaſon is at hand; for if thou conſider the point in Controverſy, did but he think that thou couldeſt judg better then himſelf, he would aſſent unto thee, and there would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main no difference. But inaſmuch as he diſſents from thee, he muſt needs conceive himſelf to judg better, in other things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he may ſeem to preferr thee before himſelf; but he doth not do it indeed, and in Truth: for if each of you ſhal reckon up his opinions, in ſuch points wherein you ſhal both agree, he wil approve his own judgment as much as thine, and in ſuch, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſhal differ from thee, he wil queſtionleſs preferr his own judgment before thine, and ſo wil take himſelf to be the wiſer of the two. This is moſt manifeſt in our paſſing of our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning writers. For, ſo far thou wilt praiſe any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, as he ſhal ſatisfie thy judgment, and ſo far thou wilt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like him, as he ſhal not content thee, ſo that every mans rule, whereby he meaſures what is right or wrong, is his own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Which being ſo, who ever the Controverſie be with, ſuppoſe he be the moſt ignorant fellow in the world, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thou takeſt thy ſelf to be one that can ſpeak Oracles; look how ill thou canſt bear it, to be contemned by him, as ill wil he take it, to be contemned by thee; and peradventure he will take it ſo much the worſe, by how much he hath bin leſs inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly brought up. Shal I tel thee in a word, how thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to deal with him, ſo as to avoid bitterneſs? Imagine the caſe to be quite contrary; ſuppoſe him to be ſuch an one as thou ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt thy ſelf to be; thy ſelf to be ſuch as thou deemeſt him, and then look what behaviour of thine would become each of you,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:150539:42"/> if the caſe ſo ſtood, endeavour with all thy might to expreſs. If thou ſhalt not thus do, a thouſand to one, thou ſhalt not avoid, inſolently to carry thy ſelf. Whoſoever ſhal daily meditate of theſe things, and carefully exerciſe his mind in the practiſe of them; he doubtleſs (if I am not miſtaken) ſhal become an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent diſputant, very fit by way of reaſoning, to reſiſt the growth of Errors. Of which way of reſiſtance by Reaſon, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we have ſufficiently treated; we are in the next place to ſpeak of Authority.</p>

Of what ill Conſequence it is to account a point to be funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, and neceſſary to be known to ſalvation, when it is not ſuch. The truth of a point one thing, the weight and conſequence thereof another. Scriptures aſſerting the truth, do not conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſert the weight of a point. The Scriptures can only declare the weight of a point, and how we are to improve them to that end. Whether in caſe it appear, that ſuch or ſuch a thing must needs be ſo or ſo, it follow, that that thing muſt needs be known to ſalvation? In Caſe it appear from Scripture, that a Point ought of neceſſity be known to ſalvation, whether are all truths following therefrom, of like neceſſity to be known and acknowledged? A man may firmly hold a poſition, and deny ſuch things as neceſſarily follow therefrom, ſo long as be ſhal not diſcover the neceſſity of ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences. What Points are in the Scriptures held forth, as of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:150539:42" rendition="simple:additions"/> neceſſity to be known and believed to ſalvation? Men may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, though they miſ-underſtand ſome points, and hold ſome Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. It is very remarkable, that our Lord gave the tokens of his body and blood to his Diſciples, when as yet they knew not that his Kingdom was a ſpiritual Kingdom, nor yet that the Gentiles ſhould be ſaved by him, and that in a peculiar ſort before the <hi>Jews.</hi> An enumeration of ſuch points as the Scriptures account needful to be known and believed to ſalvation, and of ſuch as to the ignorance whereof damnation is threatned. What points they be which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing from the former, by way of conſequence, are like wiſe need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be known. In all other differences, we are to hold a brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peace and union. It is needleſs, and endleſs to reckon up ſuch points as are not neceſſarily to be known to ſalvation. To believe a point, is not to repeat the words, but to embrace the ſenſe of them. Of what moment that Controverſie is, between the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> (as they are termed) about the preſence of Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the Sacrament, whether the erring party, err damnably. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we condemn any man for an Error, we muſt be very wel aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that it is ſuch an Error, as deprives of ſalvation. Many points held neceſſary to be known to ſalvation, which cannot by any Text of Scripture beproved to be ſuch. What did the believing thief, the <hi>Eunuch</hi> baptized by <hi>Philip,</hi> the harlot that waſhed our Lords feet, the Palſied perſon that was healed, know and believe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſt? A perſon that errs damnably, and cannot be reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ought to be excluded a Chriſtian Congregation, whether he promiſe not to ſeduce, or do not ſo promiſe. He that errs in a point not fundamental, if after admonition he ceaſe not by ſpreading his Error to trouble the Church, he ought to be caſt out. He that errs an Error not damnable, and makes no ſtirr by ſeducing, muſt be retained in Communion. All means muſt be uſed to reduce a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that errs fundamentally, before he be cut off from Communion of the Church. Care muſt be taken, that they Arrogate not unto themſelves the judgment of any doctrine or perſon, to whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs not in ſuch caſes to judg. It belongs to the whale Church to judg in ſuch a Caſe. What the Magiſtrate may do to reſiſt Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. When it is once grown in uſe, to determine Controverſies by the ſword, what ever Doctrine comes to be the Doctrine of the major part, and ſtronger ſide, who ever ſhal oppoſe the ſame, wil
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:150539:43"/> be counted an Heretick, and all his Arguments and Scriptures produced, ſhal be anſwered by none but the Hangman. Better never any Heretick be puniſhed by the ſword, then ſuch a door ſet open to the bloodſhed of profeſſors of the Truth. Putting Hereticks to death, in ſtead of ſuppreſſing, oft times encreaſes them. Paſtors are thereby made lazy and unlearned, and to loſe the uſe of their ſpiritual weapons. Afflicting Hereticks, hardens them in their Errors, becauſe afflicting is the portion of thoſe that profeſs the Truth. Of putting a ſeducer to death under the old Teſtament, and of the beating down the City that falls to Idolatry. Of the reaſon of that Law, <hi>that all Iſrael may fear, and do no more ſo.</hi> The Parable of the Tares diſcuſſed.

Great difference between an Heretick and an Apoſtate, from the true God and true Religion. The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate cannot doubt of a mans being an Apoſtate, in caſe he be, but of his being an Heretick, he may wel doubt. Few Magiſtrates able to judg of an Heretick. Who ever bears the ſword, wil be thought to hold the Truth, and all that are contrary-minded muſt be Hereticks. The Magiſtrate greatly concerned to examine what his duty is in this point. Wherein the danger lies, that if the tares be pluckt up, the wheat alſo ſhould be pluckt up. He that cannot judg who is an Heretick, cannot determine what Doctrine is Hereſie.</p>

            <p>HAving divided the Authority, whereby falſe Tenets are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed into that of the Church, and that other of the civill Magiſtrate: we ſhal firſt ſpeak of the Church. If therefore any one ſhal teach ſuch things as are not agreeable to the Word of God, to the end ſuch Doctrines may not prevail; two things the Church may do; damn the Doctrine as erroneous and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and cut off the perſon from the body of the Church, as a withered branch; in which proceedings there may be a triple
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:150539:43"/> Error committed. Firſt, if any Doctrine or perſon be unjuſtly condemned; ſecondly, if they be otherwiſe condemned then ſtands with juſtice; thirdly, if they be condemned by other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons then they ought to be. In the firſt place, any thing is unju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly condemned, if it be not falſe; which Error how to avoid, may be known by what hath bin ſaid in our firſt book. Again, a matter is unjuſtly condemned, if the ſentence be more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous then the matter requires, which is in Controverſie. For all points of true Doctrine are not of one kind. Some are ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be known, as that all ought to hold them firm and undoubted. Others there are which being controverted between Church and Church, do not break the unity of Faith. Now in caſe an Error of this kind ſhal be ſo ſentenced, as if it bereft the perſons erring of all hope of ſalvation, the judgment wil not be right. Here we are to conſider, whether it make any matter in ſuch Caſes, to give juſt or uniuſt ſentence. Moſt men, if thou ſhalt not account every Error to be of the largeſt ſize, they wil ſay thou maintaineſt Errors, that thou art a patron of erroneous perſons; whoſe godly care to preſerve the purity of Doctrine, truly I commend: notwithſtanding, I conceive it wil be labour wel beſtowed, to examine more ſurely, whether in ſo doing a man be indeed a patronizer of Errors. Doubtleſs, concerning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny point, every man inclines either to the negative or affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, to the one ſide or other, or he is in doubt concerning that point.

For every perturbation of mind, weakens the iudgment, and caſts a miſt before the Soul, and is ever joyned with a diſtruſt of Gods mercy to the party, then which, what can leſs conduce to ſalvatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>? Yea rather, what doth more hinder? What a door is thereby opened for <hi>Satan,</hi> to overthrow all the miſerable mans hope, and caſt very many pernicious thoughts into his mind? I confeſs, it is poſsible that a mind ſo dejected, may lift it ſelf up to God, and both implore and obtain his aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, for to come to a ſure knowledg of the Truth. But though this may befall ſome, who can deny but that it may betide ſome,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:150539:44"/> as we ſaid before. Touching thoſe that have attained to know the Truth, the point being (as we make the ſuppoſition) not of neceſsity to be known, they are not delivered from any very great danger; but thoſe that have occaſion to diſtruſt the mercy of God towards them, their ſalvation is in very great danger. Whence it follows, that ſuch as doubt of any point, are more harmed, in caſe they ſhal judg that neceſſary to be known, which is not; then if they ſhal eſteem it to be of no greater weight then indeed it is. And he which is perſwaded of the Truth of ſuch apoint, though he take the falſe part; he conceives he ſhal offend God, if he ſhal not endeavour, as much as in him lies, to perſwade all others of the Truth of that which he conceives himſelf to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; and therefore he wil endeavour to do it publiquely, if he may be ſuffered, at leaſt, he cannot but do his beſt privately, which he would never go about, or to be ſure, not with ſo much earneſtneſs, if he did eſteem the thing to be of leſs moment. Now, for ſuch in whom an Error hath taken root; what is there that can ſo hinder them from being reclaimed, as to think that they cannot change their judgment without loſs of their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore it is, that they dare not hear him that would teach them better. And refuſing ſo to do, what way is left to reduce them? Such as think aright, I confeſs, by how much greater weight they conceive any point to be of, wil ſo much the more unwillingly give eare to any that ſhal call their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into queſtion. But in caſe the matter ſhal be of leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence then they ſuppoſe, herein their miſtake wil be very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; in that they wil ſeparate the parties ſo erring, from the reſt of the body of Chriſt, to wit the Church; wil contemn them, wil hold them accurſed: and they wil be forced to make a ſect by themſelves, then which nothing can be more deſtructive: For we ſee what deadly enmity is between ſects. And hatred is the cauſe, that what ever is affirmed by one ſect, is apt to be ſuſpected by the oppoſite ſect, and to be contradicted. And whatſoever hath raſhly bin uttered, baſe pride, and affectation of Contrariety, wil not ſuffer it to be re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>racted, but wil have it, with all pertinacy, maintained. And when once it is grown into a cuſtom, that for every difference of iudgment, one man wil condemn another, you ſhal ſee ſects ſpring out of ſects daily;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:150539:44"/> which multitude of ſects, out of a diſpair to find the Truth, hath occaſioned very many men to throw aſide all thought of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So that if any man do ſeriouſly weigh, how much the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of ſects do hinder the courſe of the Goſpel, together with the hatreds and diſſentions that are between them; he wil eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtand, that nothing can be more accommodated to the Counſels of <hi>Satan,</hi> then ſuch raſh judgments, from whence the ſects ariſe. It is far better to eſteem everything by its iuſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, and neither to encreaſe nor diminiſh the ſame. Which reſolution is the more to be prized, inaſmuch as Chriſt himſelf, being the only maintainer of pure Doctrine, needs not the aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of any falſe perſwaſion to that effect: for what defence can a lie afford? The matter then thus ſtanding, we muſt in the next place enquire after ſome way, ſo to ballance and poiſe the weight and conſequence of matters, as that we may not err in this caſe.</p>
            <p>Now in the firſt place, this ought to be layd down for a ſure rule; that if we ſhal depart from the Divine Oracles, contained in the holy Scriptures, there is nothing whereto we may ſafely truſt; there is nothing but what is liable, either to fraud or Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror: Gods Teſtimonies are only ſure, they only are of that worth, that the Conſcience of a man may reſt upon them, and quiet it ſelf. And doubtleſs, if there ſhal be ſuch a Cuntroverſy about any point of Religion, as that ſome ſhal ſay, it is a point ſo neceſſary to be reſolved about, and to know the Truth of, as that he which ſhal not underſtand and cloſe with it, cannot be ſaved poſſibly; others, though they are of the ſame judgment, for the point it ſelf, ſhal yet deny, that it is of ſuch weight, and rather conceive that ſuch as judg amiſs thereabout, may attain ſalvation: and ought notwithſtanding to be reputed members of the Church: In caſe (I ſay) ſuch a Controverſie ariſe, when both ſides cannot be ſaid to judg according to Truth, the one or other muſt of neceſſity err. Wherefore, to be certainly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, which part thinks aright, wil be to know ſome what; even as, to be at a ſtand and doubt herein, wil be to be ignorant of ſomewhat; whence it muſt be concluded, that we cannot come to certain knowledg in this point, unleſs there be ſome word of God extant to guide us. Now we muſt be ſure to mark in this
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:150539:45"/> place, that a point of Religion, and the judgment which is made concerning the weight and conſequence of that point, are very different things. As it is one thing to ſay; A Chriſtian ought not to be Circumciſed; another thing to ſay, if ye be Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, Chriſt ſhal profit you nothing. For he which had heard, how that a Chriſtian muſt not be Circumciſed; might yet think, that though a Chriſtian ſhould not be Circumciſed, yet if a man iudg that he ought to be Circumciſed, it were not much material. But having heard that other word; If you be Circumciſed, Chriſt ſhal profit you nothing, he wil now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the matter to be of fargreater importance. And inaſmuch as a Doctrine is one thing, and the iudgment and eſtimation of the weight of that Doctrine is another: if it ſhal be put to the queſtion, concerning any Tenet, whether or no it be a point which ought of neceſsity to be known; as for example, <hi>that it is lawful to ſwear before the Judg;</hi> it wil be nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for a man to bring many Texts to prove, that an oath in point of judicature, ought not to be refuſed; for it wil be ſaid by one or other, that I grant, neither do I any ways make ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thereof, but I would be reſolved concerning the weight of the thing, whether it be a matter of ſuch conſequence, as that, in caſe any man ſhal be perſwaded, that he ought not in any caſe to ſwear, and ſhal remain in that Error, there is no hope of his ſalvation. So that ſuch proofs are in this caſe requiſite, not which evince, that a man ought to ſwear before the Bench (for that is not the thing in queſtion) but which prove, that he which is perſwaded he ought not to ſwear, ſhal be damned, ſuch as there is concerning the not retaining of Circumciſion.</p>
            <p>Now a point is then to be accounted proved by divine Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, when the Teſtimony or Text cannot be true, unleſs the point in queſtion be true, which may come to paſs, both when the Text ſhal contain the very thing, which it is brought to prove, as alſo when it ſhal lay down that, which being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the other muſt of neceſſity follow; as for example: we are to prove that a man is accounted juſt by beleeving, and not by the works of the Law, we alledg the words of <hi>Paul; We judg therefore, that by faith, a man is iuſtified without the works of the Law.</hi> This Teſtimony expreſſes the very thing which we
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:150539:45"/> would prove. But ſuppoſe it were to be proved, <hi>that a man is iuſtified only by faith,</hi> and one did thus reaſon: Unleſs there were only one way of Juſtification, and that by Faith; the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had fooliſhly inferred, that foraſmuch as <hi>the iuſt ſhould live by faith,</hi> and that works were not faith, therefore no man living is juſt by the works of the Law; but it cannot without great wickedneſs be charged upon the Apoſtle, that he reaſoned fooliſhly; there is therefore righteouſneſs in faith alone, and ſo a man is juſtified only by faith. Now this Teſtimony of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, cannot be ſaid to contain that which it is brought to prove, but yet it affirms ſuch things as being granted, the point in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion muſt needs follow. But if ſo be, that which is brought as a Teſtimony may be true, while the thing it is brought to prove may be falſe, that thing cannot be ſaid to be proved, by ſuch a Teſtimony; ſo that, if a man to ſhew that the Pope hath Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to make new Laws, wherewith to bind the Conſciences of men, ſhal cite that place, <hi>what ever thou ſhalt bind on earth, ſhal be bound in heaven;</hi> it wil be therefore denyed, that that place proves the point in queſtion, becauſe power of binding might be given to <hi>Peter,</hi> and yet no power be given to the Pope to make new Laws.</p>
            <p>Now a thing may be expreſſed, either by comprehenſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der general terms, or word for word; for when as the general term [Law] comprehends, as wel thoſe Laws concerning Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, as thoſe concerning religious Ceremonies; as wel Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Laws, as Humane; that Chriſt ſhal not profit him, who ſhal place his Righteouſneſs in keeping the moral Law; is in general terms comprehended in that ſpeech of the Apoſtle, where he denys that they have any ſhare in Chriſt, who place their Righteouſneſs in the works of the Law. And that a man is juſtified by Faith, is in ſo many words comprehended, in that paſſage of the ſame Apoſtle. <hi>We iudg therefore, that a man is iuſtified by Faith, without the works of the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, as concerning our preſent occaſion; I find that one thing may follow from another, two manner of ways. One is, when a matter is laid down as neceſſary to be known, which cannot yet be underſtood and believed, unleſs ſome other thing ſhal be firſt underſtood and believed; for in ſuch a caſe, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:150539:46"/> is to be reckoned among ſuch things as are of neceſsity to be known. Thus; inaſmuch as it is neceſſary, that we believe that Chriſt is rifen from the dead, and we cannot believe that, unleſs we ſhal likewiſe believe that he died, it is altogether neceſſary that we believe he died. The other way is this; if we find ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſet down, that a matter more doubtful then the point in queſtion, whether it ought of neceſsity to be known, is to be known neceſſarily, yea if it be notleſs doubtful; for that which is leſs doubtful, or at leaſt, not more doubtful, muſt be as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary as the other.</p>
            <p>But ſome may demand; whether in caſe it be apparent, that ſuch a thing muſt needs be, or ſuch a thing ought to have bin done, it ought therefore to be j dged, that ſuch a thing muſt neceſſarily be known by us. I wil explain my meaning by a compariſon. Phyſitians cure him that is ſick of an hot diſeaſe, by cooling medicines; neither is it any matter, though the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient be ignorant of the faculties of ſuch medicines, provided he make uſe of them. We in like manner were ſick of a certain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, being liable to death by ſin; many things may be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, which that we might be ſaved, ought both to be, and to be performed; As that our ſins were to be aboliſhed, and that by a Man void of all ſin, and of infinite vertue and power, and he therefore to be the ſon of God, yea God himſelf, and the like. But let us lay down among the reſt, that it was altogether neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that he ſhould be accuſed, and in a iudicial way, ſentenced to ſuffer death. Some man (I ſay) may demand; whether or no, that, look how neceſſary it was, that our Lord ſhould die, being condemned to death by a Judg; it ſhould be as neceſſary for a man to know, not only that he died of any faſhion, but as one accuſed, and judicially condemned: or whether we may not as wel be ignorant of that circumſtance, as a man ſick of an hot diſeaſe, may, without prejudice, be ignorant of the faculty of ſuch medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines as are adminiſtred unto him; as alſo whence, and how they were provided. Doubtleſs, that it may evidently appear to us, that theſe things are likewiſe neceſſarily to be known, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we muſt have a plain Text of Scripture that ſhal pronounce, <hi>whatſoever is neceſſary to be done, that alſo (to attain ſalvation) must neceſſarily be believed;</hi> or we muſt conclude, that becauſe it
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:150539:46"/> is ſaid in Scripture, that ſuch a thing was neceſſarily to be done; it therefore follows, that it muſt neceſſarily be known. But there is no Teſtimony of Scripture, that I know, which pronounces, that what ever ought to be done, ought to be believed; and whether or no, becauſe a thing is pronounced neceſſary to be done; it therefore follows, that it muſt neceſſarily be believed, we may thus reſolve our ſelves; ſuppoſe it is thus written in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>It was altogether neceſſary for the taking away of the ſins of men, that Chriſt ſhould be condemned by the Judg, and ſo ſuffer death; if he had died otherwiſe, then in a judicial way, his death would not have profited mankind.</hi> Now ſome man would by this Teſtimony prove, that unleſs one believed that Chriſt ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red death, being condemned to die, he cannot be ſaved. The queſtion therefore is, whether that Teſtimony do prove any ſuch thing, or no. But it is apparent, that no ſuch thing is by this Teſtimony proved; foraſmuch as the Teſtimony may be true, while that which it is brought to prove it, is falſe; that ſpeech which is contradictory to that which is to be proved, being not contradictory to that which is uſed as a Teſtimony. For, ſince it is one thing, that Chriſt ought to die in a judicial way; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to believe, that he ought ſo to die; he that ſays, that man may be ſaved, who was ignorant that Chriſts death was in a judicial way, contradicts not him that ſays, it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that Chriſt ſhould die, being condemned; and there is nothing to hinder, but that both thoſe propoſitions may be true. Which being ſo, we cannot conceive that this Teſtimony proves, that he which ſhal not believe that Chriſt died, being condemned in judgment, cannot be ſaved. Whence it follows, that to prove that ſomething ought of neceſſity to be done, or to be, is no Argument that ſuch a thing ought of neceſſity to be believed.</p>
            <p>Some may further demand; whether in caſe it appear from Scripture, that a Doctrine ought of neceſsity to be known, we ſhould account whatſoever may be collected from that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine by neceſſary inference, to be in like manner needful to be known; in which eaſe we muſt obſerve, that look how (as we ſaid before) a Tenet is one thing, and the eſtimation of that Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net is another thing; ſo it is one thing for a point or Doctrine to follow from another point, another thing for a ſpeech to follow
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:150539:47"/> expreſsing the weight of that Doctrine; now this latter kind of conſequence, ought not to be doubted of. For ſince it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Chriſt ſhal profit you nothing, who place your Righteouſneſs in the Law,</hi> and Circumciſion is an Ordinance of that Law; if any one ſhould ſay, that it is poſsible for him who places his Righteouſneſs in Circumciſion, to receive profit by Chriſt, he ſhould contradict the very words of <hi>Paul.</hi> But our queſtion is concerning ſuch inferences as are the Conſequences of ſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine it ſelf, which ought of neceſsity to be known. Inaſmuch therefore, as to grant the Antecedent and deny the Conſequent, is to affirm contradictions; he which denys, that which neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily follows from a Doctrine that ought to be known, he may not ſeem truly to believe the ſaid Doctrine; and therefore not in a poſsibility of ſalvation. But I anſwer; ſeeing that I grant the Antecedent point which is neceſſary to be known, though I deny that which ſeemeth unto thee neceſſarily to follow therefrom, why ſhouldeſt thou not as wel ſay, that I do not in truth deny, that which I ſeem to deny? Since (I ſay) to grant the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and deny the Conſequent, cannot ſtand together; why ſhould the denying of the Conſequent rather ſeem, a denying of the Antecedent, which I confeſs to be true, then the affirming of the Antecedent ſhould ſeem to be an affirming of the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, which I affirm to be falſe? for it is as true, that the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming of the Antecedent affirms the Conſequent, as it is, that the denyal of the Conſequent denies the Antecedent. Now it is cicar, that he which underſtands that ſuch a thing follows from ſuch a thing, cannot poſsibly affirm the one, and deny the other. And if ſo be any man conceiving the Antecedent to be true, wil not admit of the Conſequence; the reaſon hereof is, that he doth not diſcern, that the one follows from the other; for, to ſee that this follows from that, and to account that true, and this falſe, were no other then to ſee it, and not to ſee it, which is impoſsible. Now that it may fall out, that what neceſſarily follows from ſome Tenet, may not by ſome man be diſcerned ſo to follow, is ſo certain as nothing more; for how many things are there, both in the <hi>Methematicks,</hi> and other Arts, which being undeniably demonſtrated to be true, are yet both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and unbelieved by many men, which underſtand not their
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:150539:47"/> Demonſtrations. As for example, that the body of the Sun, is by many parts greater then the whole Earth. And if ſo be any man ſhal affirm things contrary to what are demonſtrated, as that the Sun is greater then the Earth, he ſhal affirm things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uld not underſtand them to be true, to wit, thoſe maximes out of which the ſaid things are demonſtrated. But therefore it is, that thoſe maximes to ſome men are evident and firm, who wil not believe ſuch things as follow from them by neceſſary conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m connexion, which is between the ſaid max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes and ſuch things as follow therefrom; otherwiſe, ſince no man is ignorant of the truth of thoſe principles, from whence the Demonſtrations are raiſed, every body would know the truth of ſuch things as might be demonſtrated, and ſo we ſhould have all men <hi>Geometricians, Arithmeticians,</hi> all men <hi>Muſitians</hi> and <hi>Aſtrologers.</hi> And becauſe it may fall out, that what follows from ſome other thing, may not be diſcerned by ſome man to follow the ſame; and he may therefore believe the former and not the latter; doubtleſs it is no proof, that becauſe a man denyes a neceſſary Conſequence, he muſt therefore deny the Antecedent, being a point which ought of neceſſity to be known; eſpecially, if he ſhal be ſo ſtrongly perſwaded of the truth of the Antecedent, that rather then he wil deny the ſame, he wil allow of the Conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>quent for Truth. But in caſe he would rather deny the Antecedent, then allow of the Conſequent, the caſe is d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt therefore, that ſuch Teſtimonies of Scripture as prove, a point ought neceſſarily to be known, do not prove, that ſuch things as neceſſarily follow, are of like ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

This part of our diſcourſe is ſubtile and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, requiring that the reader give great heed, to the end he may underſtand the ſame: howbeit, it is very neceſſary to be known, for the taking away of raſh judgments, by means whereof the Church is torn in pieces into Sects.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being thus cleared, we are in the next place to enquire, what thoſe points be, which are propounded unto us in the Scripture, as ſo neceſſary to be known and believed, that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:150539:48"/> he which ſhal not know and throughly underſtand them, ought not to be accounted one of Gods ſervants, or a member of his Church; and whoſoever ſhal believe them, all may be judged capable of Salvation, though he very much err in all other points. Concerning which queſtion, I would much rather hear the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of other men, then propound mine own to the raſh, and haply, irreligious cenſures of many: howbeit, the hope of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the Tranquillity and peace of the Churches of Chriſt, hath more prevailed with me, then any private reſpect of mine own. We do not preſcribe any thing to any man, as a decree, from which he may not diſſent; but look what the Lord hath vouchſafed to diſcover unto us, we thought good in ſuch wiſe to propound; as to be ready with a very good wil, to give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and place to him that ſhal propound matters of greater cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. Our endeavour, truly, is not by all means poſſible, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude our own judgment upon men, and to make, that it may be of authority; but rather that Truth it ſelf may be brought to Light. For look as it often comes to paſs, that a muſician that could not be intreated by any means to play a leſſon; if ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful perſon ſhal be his untoward fingering of ſome in-it-ſelf, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent inſtrument, grate and vex his ears with his rude ſcraping, wil take the inſtruments in hand and begin to play: even ſo, our hope is, that in caſe we ſhal ſeem to have ſaid little to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, in a matter which, without all Controverſie, is of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt moment that can be; we ſhal at the leaſt, provoke ſome man of greater ſpirit and wiſdom, to accompliſh with good ſucceſs, what we had unhappily undertaken. In the mean time, we do again &amp; again beſeech all pious and good men, that what ever they ſhal think of our judgment here delivered: they wil notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, take in good part our care to preſerve peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord: and that not of any kind, but ſuch as may become Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and that they wil joyn with me by fervent prayers, to beg of him who is the only Author, as of all other good things, ſo likewiſe of peace, that he would at the length beſtow the ſame upon his Churches, to the praiſe and glory of his own name. Let us weigh then, and examine ſuch places of Scripture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Salvation is either promiſed or denyed, becauſe of believing, or not believing.</p>
            <pb n="75" facs="tcp:150539:48"/>
            <p>Our Lord ſays: <hi>Be ye ſure of this, he that hears my words,</hi>

               </gap>, but whatſoever is conteined therein is true: there is not, in the mean time, one perhaps, there never was, who underſtands the true ſence of every place. Much more may that man be ſaid to believe, who being pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſwaded of the Truth of the ſpeaker, doth likewiſe underſtand that which he ſpeaks. Now I conceive it is out of Controverſie, that every man ought to hold for Truth, whatſoever the Son of God hath taugh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

But whether or no it be likewiſe neceſſary to Salvation, to know what ever our Lord commanded as wel in perſon, as by his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and rightly to underſtand the ſame; ſo as to imbrace the ſame, not only with a confuſed, that is to ſay, a general, but with a diſtinct and particular faith; this is that which may be queſtioned.</p>
            <p>Now it is altogether neceſſary; that, either whatſoever things are ſet down in Scripture, are all neceſſary to be known; ſo that a man may not be ignorant of, or miſ-underſtand any of them under pain of damnation; or that ſuch things are of a different nature; ſo that ſome of them are altogether neceſſary to be known, and highly to be accounted of others; howbeit profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to be underſtood, and ſuch as are no ways to be ſlighted,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:150539:49"/> yet are they not altogether ſo neceſſary; yea rather, although there happen to be ſome <hi>Error</hi> concerning them, the perſon ſo erring may notwithſtanding be ſaved. And our Lord himſelf profeſſes, <hi>that he teaches nothing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 17.</note> 
               <hi>but ſuch things as he had received from his father; and look what he had received from his Father, that he delivered to his Diſciples, and that they imbraced it, and did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he was ſent from his Father: and therefore he prays for their ſalvation, and for the ſalvation of all thoſe likewiſe, who ſhould believe through their preaching.</hi> And to the Apoſtles, this command was given; <hi>Go ye through the whole world, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Goſpel to all perſons, and teaching them to obſerve what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I have commanded you; he that ſhal believe, and ſhall be baptized, ſhal be ſaved: he that ſhal not believe, ſhal be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> In which words is implyed, that unleſs a man ſhal under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and believe all theſe things, he ſhal not be ſaved; ſo <hi>Paul,</hi> when to the Jaylor, asking what he ſhould do, he bad him <hi>believe in the Lord Ieſus, and ſo he ſhould be ſaved, and his family;</hi> is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward ſaid to have inſtructed him in the Doctrine of the Lord: So that the meaning of thoſe words, <hi>believe in the Lord Ieſus and thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> muſt be this; imbrace the faith and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt and thou ſhalt be ſaved. And that this is ſo, ſeems eſpecially proved, by what the ſame Apoſtle elſewhere writes: <hi>If any one ſhal teach you otherwiſe then we have taught, let him be accurſed.</hi> For he teacheth otherwiſe, who miſ-interprets any part of that Doctrine. On the contrary, even as <hi>Paul,</hi> to prove that righteouſneſs was not by the Law, among others, uſes this Argument: <hi>If ſo be the inheritance belonged to them that kept the Law: ſince no man could keep the ſame, no body could be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: wherefore ſince the promiſe must not be void, there muſt needs be another righteouſneſs then that by the Law:</hi> In the very ſelf ſame manner we may reaſon in this place: that, foraſmuch as no man can rightly underſtand all that the Lord hath commanded; and it is neceſſary to ſalvation, that a man underſtand all things rightly, and err in nothing, therefore no man ſhal be ſaved: But certain it is,<note place="margin">Rev. 7.</note> 
               <hi>a very great and innumerable company ſhal be ſaved:</hi> it muſt needs therefore follow, that men may be ſaved, though they do not rightly underſtand ſome part of that which the Lord hath delivered, and be poſſeſſed with ſome <hi>Error.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:150539:49" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>that in this life we know things, but in part, and not fully,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> 
               <hi>and we prophecy but in part.</hi> But what could we deſire more plain then this? Our Lord before his death teſtified, that <hi>his Diſciples had imbraced all thoſe things, which, he having received of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, had declared unto them, and praye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for them:</hi> howbeit they did not as yet underſtand, <hi>that Chriſts Kingdom was ſpirituall, not worldly:</hi> neither did they know, that the benefits purchaſed by Chriſt, <hi>did belong unto the other nations of the world as wel as to the Iews.</hi> Which things notwithſtanding, he had taught them, and they were matters of very great concernment. It is manifeſt therefore, that when our Lord ſaid, his Diſciples had received ſuch things as he had taught them: his meaning was, ſuch of them as were of neceſſity to ſalvation; not that they had wholly attained to the knowledg of all that he had taught them. Hence it muſt be concluded, that all things which Chriſt taught, were not ſo neceſſary to ſalvation, as that, if a man were ignorant of ſome part of them, he could not be ſaved. And it is very wel worth our obſervation, that, when as the Diſciples did not as yet underſtand that Chriſts Kingdom was ſpiritual, and that the Gentiles were in a ſpecial manner to be ſhaters in the ſalvation purchaſed by him: he did notwithſtanding diſtribute unto them the repreſentative fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of his body and blood.</p>
            <p>Inaſmuch therefore, as it is out of all queſtion, that every Truth of God is not of like condition and rank, but that ſome muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be known and perfectly underſtood, ſome may be without inevitable damnation unknown; doubtleſs it is neceſſary, either that we ſhould have ſome mark of difference whereby to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the one from the other, or we muſt take it for granted, that thoſe points of Chriſtian doctrine are only neceſſary to be known, concerning which there are ſpecial and particular teſtimonies of Scripture ſignifying the neceſſity of their knowledg. As for any general note or difference, though I have diligently enquired into the matter, yet have I not been able to find one. For, if any man ſhal ſay that all the principal heads of doctrine are to be reckoned among the neceſſary points; his ſaying wil be very true, yet not a whit ſatisfactory. For I ſhal preſently demand, which are thoſe principal points? And if any doctrine be called into queſtion, I ſhal deſire to know whether it be one of thoſe principal ones: I ſhal
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:150539:50"/> ask him by what note or mark I may know, whether it be to be reckoned among the principal or not: So that we are ſtil as far to ſeek as ever. For it is all one to be in doubt which are thoſe points of doctrine that ought of neceſſity to be known, and to doubt which are the chief heads of Religion, both are alike obſcure, ſo that the one cannot receive light from the other. We muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make diligent enquiry, what things they are by name which muſt be of neceſſity known and beleeved.</p>
            <p>Our Lord ſays: <hi>Herein conſists life eternal, if they ſhal know thee the only true God,</hi>

               <hi>he was baptized.</hi> Likewiſe, <hi>when four men carrying the pulſied man, and endeavoring to bring him to be

For he beleeved (in all probability) that that ſame man, whoſe name was Jeſus, came from God and was in favor with God; and therefore he hoped that by his means he might recover his health. But that he knew all thoſe things which the Church hath for a long time accounted as articles of Faith neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be beleeved to Salvation, how likely a matter it is, I leave it to every man to judg. There are likewiſe many other texts to the very ſame purpoſe. For to that ſame unclean woman, that waſhed our Lords feet with her tears, it was ſaid: <hi>Thy Faith hath ſaved thee</hi> The ſame was ſpoken to that other woman having the flux of blood, who hoped, <hi>If ſhe might touch the hem of his garment, ſhe ſhould be healed.</hi> The ſame was done to that one of the ten cleanſed lepers, who returned thanks to God. And <hi>Iohn</hi> ſays, <hi>Hereby ye ſhal know the Spirit of God; whatever ſpirit ſhal confeſs that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is come, and that he is made man, that Spirit is of God; and again; Whoſoever ſhal confeſs that Ieſus is the Son of God, God abides in him and he in God.</hi> Alſo <hi>Paul</hi> denies, <hi>That any can ſay that Ieſus is the Lord, but by the holy Spirit.</hi> And foraſmuch as <hi>Abraham</hi> is called the <hi>Father of Beleevers,</hi> and we are taught chiefly by his example, <hi>that Righteouſneſs conſiſts in Faith:</hi> Truly it wil be labor wel beſtowed to conſider, what that was, <hi>which when he beleeved, it was counted unto him for righteouſneſs.</hi> He was promiſed that he ſhould be the Father of many Nations; he was promiſed that happineſs ſhould betide to all the Nations of the world by his ſeed: Finally, he had the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> promiſed to him, and very great proſperity: But of thoſe points of Religion, which it is judged every body is bound to know upon pain of damnation, we read not a word. Yea, and the myſtery of Salvation it ſelf by his ſeed is very cloſely and obſcurely promiſed. And, truly theſe are the only points which I find in the Scriptures, recorded as neceſſary to be beleeved for the attainment of Salvation. Let us now conſider who they be, unto whom in Scripture Salvation is denyed in reſpect of unbelief.</p>
            <p>Unto the Apoſtles it was ſaid in general terms; <hi>Go ye through

He that ſhal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that by the name of Chriſt he ſhal be ſaved, he ſhal be ſaved; he that ſhal not ſo beleeve ſhal be condemned.

               <hi>If any ſhal teach you different from what you have learned, let him be accurſed:</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid: If any ſhal teach you, that you muſt obtain ſalvation by any other way, then by faith in the name of Chriſt, let him be accurſed. Howbeit, whoſoever ſhal teach any thing otherwiſe then the Apoſtles taught, although it be none of the principal heads of Religion, yet is he ſo far forth to be accurſed, in as much as all falſe doctrine comes from none but the Devil, the father of lyes. But it is not preſently to be concluded that ſuch a perſon is quite out of the way of Salvation; for our Lord rebuking <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf becauſe he dehorted him from ſuffering death, calls him <hi>Satan.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Acts 4.</note> 
               <hi>by which we can be ſaved.</hi> By which teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Scripture we are taught, that ſuch places as witneſs that he which beleeves that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God ſhal be ſaved,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:150539:51"/> are not ſo to be underſtood, as that if a man ſhal ſo beleeve that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God, as he beleeves that <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> was the firſt who brought the <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and made himſelf Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any other matter wherein himſelf is not concerned, that he ſhal be ſaved: but that he truly beleeves that Jeſus is the Son of God, who beleeves it as a thing that concerns himſelf; that is to ſay, who beleeves that he, whom we call Jeſus, is the Son of God, his Jeſus and his Chriſt, that is, his Savior and his King, in whom alone he places all the hope of his Salvation: Unleſs we ſhal admit of this interpretation, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Pauls</hi> nor <hi>Peters</hi> words will hang together.</p>
            <p>Theſe very few points are all that we can find expreſſed in Scripture, as being neceſſary for every man to believe, to the end he may be ſaved: <hi>viz. That he acknowledg the one only true God, and him whom he hath ſent, Ieſus Chriſt his Son, being made man: and that he believe that God hath raiſed him from the dead, and that by his name he ſhal obtain ſalvation, and that he place not his righteouſneſs in the works of the Law:</hi> But that he be verily perſwaded, that there is no other name under heaven, whereby we can be ſaved. Now let us make enquiry, what other thing there is, that being inferred from theſe, may be in like manner neceſſary to be known. And foraſmuch as the Scriptures teach, that every man is liable to the ſevere judgment of God, as being, by reaſon of the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> born in ſin, and of ſuch a natural conſtitution, that he continually offends God, and conſequently guilty of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal puniſhment; and ſince they further teach, that this world at length coming to an end, all perſons ſhal be raiſed at the laſt day: <hi>the juſt unto eternal happineſs, the unjuſt and wicked unto eternal torments:</hi> No man can underſtand what it is to be ſaved, neither conſequently what it is he ſhould believe, unleſs he have ſome tollerable knowledg, both of his own condition, of the Law of God, and of Gods purpoſe to judg the quick and the dead. For the Apoſtle declares, that <hi>from the Law ſprings the knowledg of Sin, and he ſhould not have known Sin but by the Law.</hi> But it follows not, from what we have laid down, that ſuch a degree of knowledg, either of the Law of God, or of mans natural condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is neceſſary: as that, if any man ſhal err in the interpretation of ſome Commandment of God, or in judging of the nature of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:150539:52"/> man, and the abilities thereof, he cannot be ſaved. Thus much on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follows, that a man ought to believe, that he is liable to eternal condemnation, and to truſt he is freed therefrom, by Chriſt, and by his benefits ordained unto eternal bleſſedneſs. Again, ſeeing <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, that they have no title to Chriſt, who place their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in the Law, in the Law, I ſay of God; What ſhal we ſay of them who place their righteouſneſs in the Laws, mandates and inventions of men? They may doubtleſs much rather be ſaid to have fallen from the righteouſneſs and benefits of Chriſt. Semblably, ſince the Scriptures teach, that by the name of Chriſt alone, we muſt hope for ſalvation: it follows, that he that ſhal hope for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by the name of the bleſſed <hi>Virgin,</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Saint whatſoever, hath no ſhare in Chriſt. Likewiſe, it being a thing neceſſarily to be believed to ſalvation, that Chriſt was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the dead: and it cannot be underſtood, that any is raiſed to life that was not firſt dead; it follows, that it ought of neceſſity to be believed that he dyed. In a word, foraſmuch as our Lord hath commanded, that all be taught the Goſpel and baptized in the name of the Father, Son and holy Spirit whoſe work this Faith is; inaſmuch as he opens our hearts, and reveals unto us this goodneſs of God towards us; both this command ought to be known, and that it is the holy Spirit by whom we believe, and by whom God dwels in us: and whom, we ought by inceſſant prayers to begg of God, that he would beſtow him upon us. I confeſs ingeniouſly, I cannot find any other points, that I can from Scripture demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and prove to be of neceſſary knowledg to the attainment of ſalvation. If any man can ſhew any more, there is nothing that I would ſooner wiſh, then to underſtand what ever other points there are, over and above what we have laid down; and to heare thoſe Texts by whoſe authority we are obliged to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg them for matters that ought of neceſſity to be known. Now for us to reckon up particularly all ſuch points as we judg not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be known, to the end a man may be ſaved: there is no neceſſity, neither were it convenient, and it would be an endleſs work. A right line is the meaſure both of right and crooked. Only to the end, that it may be the better underſtood, when any points comes into queſtion, how it may be manifeſt, to be either of neceſſity to be known, or not of neceſſity, we wil examine and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:150539:52"/> couple of Doctrines, to the end, that as we ſhal try theſe, all other may be tryed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sabellius</hi> (as <hi>Vigilius</hi> Martyr Biſhop of <hi>Trent</hi> relates) did ſo acknowledg the Father, Son, and holy Spirit, as that he would not have it to be underſtood, that the Father was one perſon, the Son another. But he ſaid, that he who was the Father filled the womb of the Virgin, and in that man whom he aſſumed, is termed the Son: when as not two perſons, but one Father is underſtood by both termes. And he that thus underſtands the matter worſhips but one God. Some man may therefore enquire, whether or no this point be of ſuch concernment, as that it is neceſſary for him that would be ſaved, not to err therein: that is to ſay, whether <hi>Sabellius,</hi> holding ſuch an <hi>Error</hi> could be ſaved: or whether he ought abſolutely to be reckoned for an <hi>Heretick,</hi> as hitherto he hath bin ever accounted. We have already proved, that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that men ſhould believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God. But to believe, that he is the Son of God, is no to pronounce theſe words, nor yet in thought to give unto Chriſt the title of Son of God: but rather by a ſincere faith, to attribute unto him that which theſe words ſignifie. Now the word Son, ſignifies not any ſuch thing: I ſay, the notion of that word is not ſuch, as that any perſon may be underſtood to be his own Son; neither can the term [Father] be ſo underſtood, as that any one ſhould be his own Father; but he is called a Son, who hath for Father, not himſelf, but ſome other perſon; and he a Father who hath for Son, not himſelf but ſome other. Foraſmuch then as <hi>Sabellius</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the Father and the Son, and denied that they were two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct perſons; it is very plain, that he did not believe that Jeſus was the Son of God, which it was altogether neceſſary for him to believe. By which example we are taught, that concerning ſuch points as are propounded unto us by God, as neceſſary to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; we ought diligently to examine what the words ſignifie, leaſt retaining only a certain vain ſhadow of words, we come to deny the things themſelves by thoſe words intimated; let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to underſtand the words, that we may ſincerely embrace the things themſelves. Having examined this Tenet, let us conſider another point, which, as theſe times go, is perhaps, no leſs worthy of our knowledg.</p>
            <p>There hath been a long and very Tragical controverſie about the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:150539:53"/> interpretation of thoſe words, <hi>Take, this is my Body.</hi> Let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therefore whether this be a matter of ſuch conſequence, that therefore men ſhould rend themſelves one from another, vex, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and account one another as enemies. Howbeit, it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that I ſhould in this place diſcover my ſelf of what ſide I am: only I ſhal ſo far profeſs my ſelf to be of both parts, inaſmuch as I make no queſtion, but that both belong to the true Church of God. Now I ſhal deal with each ſide by it ſelf apart, and though I may grant that both parties do otherwiſe ſay right, and truly interpret the words of Chriſt: yet I ſhal ſhew, that neither party ought to condemn the other, or account it guilty of an Hereſie? Come on then, to begin with you, who admit of no <hi>Trope</hi> in our Lords words, but judg, they ought to be underſtood according to their plain natural meaning: you do not only ſay, that ſuch as account our Lords words tropical, do miſ-interpret the ſame: but you ſeem to judg of them, as of perſons, the moſt erronious in point of Religion that can be: you think you cannot find words bad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to expreſs your hatred againſt them according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts. Put the caſe, that with this their ſo great Error, they may notwithſtanding obtain Salvation, and belong to the Church of God? How can they (wil you ſay) who account the Son of God himſelf, either to be a lyar, or a vain ſpeaker, fooliſhly uttering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, and ſuch things as are quite contrary to all ſenſe and reaſon? Alas, miſerable men that we are, how far doth hatred, ſpringing from our differences, tranſport us? If men queſtion the interpretation of ſome words, muſt they needs make Chriſt a lyar? Which of thoſe men, whom you account Adverſaries in this point, did ever deny, that either in theſe or any other words Chriſt ſhould be believed? Did ſuch a conceit ever enter into any of their minds, as once to ſuſpect ſuch a thing? Could they fear that he ſhould be a lyar, for whoſe name they would ſuffer the moſt greivous tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which Tyrants could inflict? Away with ſuch a peeviſh and altogether unjuſt interpretation: the Controverſie is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the meaning, not the truth of the words, then which they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly confeſs nothing is more true. But (you wil ſay) the words are ſo clear, ſo plain and manifeſt, that it is impoſſible for a man not to underſtand their meaning. To you that underſtand them they are plain and clear, to him that otherwiſe underſtands them, they
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:150539:53"/> are not ſo clear, or if they be, it is in that ſenſe in which he takes them. Wherefore of neceſſity thus much muſt be granted: that the difference is only about the meaning, and not about the Truth of the words. Thou therefore that ſayeſt, that ſuch as deny the corporal preſence of Chriſt in the Lords Supper, are Hereticks, and cannot be ſaved: by what Teſtimonies of Scripture canſt thou prove what thou ſayeſt? Our Lord himſelf promiſes eternal life to all that call upon his name, who believe that he is the Sonne of God, who place the hope of their ſalvation in him alone, not in the works of the Law or any other thing. This faith, this hope, thoſe conſtantly profeſs whom thou calleſt Hereticks: by what Teſtimonies of Gods Word art thou induced by thy judgment to deny them ſalvation? Produce one word out of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which ſays, that ſuch perſons ſhal not enjoy eternal life. Thou mayſt not pronounce ſo from thine own head: doſt thou think, haply, that it is impoſſible for that man to call upon the name of the Lord, and to put all his confidence in him, who cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, nor conſequently believe, that his body really preſent, is diſtributed in the Sacrament? What ſhould hinder him? But if thou wilt contend, that he that believes not the latter, cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the former: I would very fain hear, how thou canſt prove what thou ſayeſt. But in caſe, that faith unto which our Lord doth promiſe ſalvation, may ſtand without the confeſſion of his bodies preſence in the Sacrament; and yet thou ceaſeſt not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count perſons ſo believing, to be no members of the true Church of God: conſider with thy ſelf again and again, if thou doſt not really pollute thy ſelf with that ſame crime of making Chriſt a lyar, which thou art accuſtomed falſly to charge upon others.</p>
            <p>I come now to thoſe who ſay the words are tropical, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is affirmed that the body of Chriſt is preſent in the bread, at the ſame time in very many places, do gather many very great abſurdities; but eſpecially this, That ſuch a poſition denies the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of Chriſt. Wherefore, inaſmuch as this point concerning the Son of God, his being made man, and raiſed from the dead, is neceſſarily to be known and believed: they deny that ſuch as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm ſuch a preſence of Chriſts body can be ſaved, unleſs they ſhal repent. Such abſurdities as they gather from the affirmation of Chriſts body (whether they err or not in ſo doing) experience doth
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:150539:54"/> manifeſt, that they can by no means be induced, but to think, that they really follow from the ſaid poſition. Let us grant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that ſuch abſurdities do all of them undoubtedly follow the foreſaid preſence. But ſuppoſing all this, muſt they therefore that hold the real preſence needs be <hi>Aliens</hi> from Chriſt? They muſt needs, (ſayſt thou) for that condition which they attribute to the body of Chriſt, that it can be in many places at one and the ſame time, overthrows the humanity of Chriſt: ſo that he which ſays, Chriſts body may be in divers places at the ſame time, doth as good as ſay, that Chriſts body is no body: and if Chriſt hath not a true body, he is not true man, and if he be not now true man, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was never made man, or if he were, he aroſe not from the dead: both which Doctrines, we before ſhewed are neceſſarily to be believed. Wherefore, ſince no man can believe contradictories, they not believing the Humanity and Reſurrection, being neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry points, cannot be ſaved. Thoſe men truly, preſs the matter ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently; howbeit, let us make tryal, if we cannot make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that hope of Salvation may ſtand with ſuch groſs <hi>Errors.</hi> Whereas therefore they ſay, that it is impoſſible for men to believe things that contradict one the other, that is then true (as we ſhewed before) when they ſee the contradiction between them. For I confeſs, that a man cannot believe, both that Chriſt hath a true humane body, and that he hath not. Howbeit, ſuch things as are truly oppoſite one to the other, may notwithſtanding ſeem unto many men, void of any ſuch oppoſition. And in caſe they are not diſcerned to be contradictory, the one to the other, nothing lets, but that men may believe them to be both true; ſo that though it be granted, that theſe Tenets oppoſe one the other, and cannot ſtand together, that there ſhould be a true body, which notwithſtanding may be in divers places, at one and the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, yet may they ſeem not to be oppoſite; ſo that men may believe, that our Lord hath a true humane body, and yet that the ſame body maybe in divers places at one &amp; theſame time. Foraſmuch therefore as they believe, and that moſt ſtrongly, that Chriſt is true man, the Son of God, and raiſed from the dead, and all other things which the Scripture holds forth as neceſſary to be believed; what reaſon haſt thou to deny that they may be ſaved, even in this their Error? It is clear therefore, that as wel thoſe which hold Chriſts body to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:150539:54"/> be in the Sacramental bread, as thoſe which deny the ſame, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it muſt needs be, that one ſide err, yet are they both (if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe conſcionable obſervers of our Lords commands) in the way of Salvation. In which regard, they are bound to love and reverence one another, as brethren, the ſervants of God, and members of Chriſt. If they ſhal mutually vex one another with revilings, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches &amp; curſings: if they ſhal go on to exerciſe enmity one againſt another, they ſhal not eſcape the juſt judgment of God. Wherefore, I pray and beſeech both parties by Chriſt Jeſus: that laying aſide all hatred and raſh judgments, they would ſtrive to go beyond one another in offices of Love. Let us abandon bad language, ſcoffs, contempt; ſo wil it certainly fall out, that ſuch as err, ſhal at the length be brought to acknowledg the Truth: If we ſhal but once be united in heart and affection, the Lord wil not deny us any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or ſucceſs; neither wil he ever ſuffer, that ſuch, as out of true love endeavour to draw their bretheren out of <hi>Error,</hi> ſhal reap no fruit of their labour.</p>
            <p>Now look how we have diſcuſſed theſe two points, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Error</hi> of <hi>Sabellius,</hi> and the Controverſie about the corporal pre-preſence in the Sacramental bread; it wil be eaſie for any man in like manner, to judg of what ever other points ſhal come into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie. For concerning what ever <hi>Error</hi> ſhal be queſtioned, we muſt enquire, whether or no, the perſon ſo erring may not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all ſuch things, as to the belief whereof Salvation is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; that in caſe he may, we may perſwade our ſelves, that he errs not in a point neceſſary to be known unto ſalvation: but if not, that he errs in a neceſſary Doctrine. Howbeit, whoſoever would condemn any man for any <hi>Error,</hi> ought to conſider again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, what aſſurance he hath, that ſuch an <hi>Error</hi> cannot ſtand with ſalvation. Do but conſider, when as our Lord ſays, <hi>come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I wil give you eaſe:</hi> Shal any man be ſo fool-hardy, as to dare to pul back him that is coming, and of his own head to ſay to him: Oh! do you hear, it wil be in vain for you to go unto Chriſt, who do not believe this or that point? Who art thou that wilt hinder another mans ſervant from coming at his Maſters call? With what confidence takeſt thou upon thee, to divine at the wil of God, not being very clearly manifeſted unto thee? Muſt you, according to your fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:150539:55"/> ſet bounds to the goodneſs, mercy and kindneſs of God? He unto whom it belongs to give life, calls all unto him; and wilt thou, by I know not what exceptions of thine own deviſing, limit thoſe graces, which he promiſeth, but limits not? What doſt thou, in ſo doing? Doubtleſs, as much as in thee lies; thou robbeſt a man of his life, not of this life which is rather a death then life, but of eternal life, and the Kingdom of Heaven, adjudging him to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal torments; neither is it to one alone, thou art ſo injurious, but to thouſands haply. Thou maimeſt Chriſt in ſo many members, thou rendeſt the Church into Sects, and paveſt a way to infinite miſchiefs. And if our Lord ſo ſeverely menace ſuch as offend the leaſt; what thinkeſt thou ſhal become of them, who by their raſh judging have drove men to make Sects, without any neceſſary cauſe ſo requiring? Wo unto them: And if ſo be the way which we have ſet down, to diſtinguiſh between points neceſſary to be believed and not neceſſary, ſeem not to be ſufficient; do thou, if thou canſt, produce a better, one more ſure, firm and conſtant. If thou wondereſt, that among ſuch points, which we have reckoned up as neceſſary to be known, thou doſt not find certain other points of Religion, very highly accounted of; Read over diligently the whole Old and New Teſtament, and ſearch throughly by what Texts thou canſt prove, that thoſe points are ſo neceſſary to be known: that he that underſtands them not, cannot be ſaved. Conſider what knowledg the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> could have of them from the Old Teſtament, who were notwithſtanding to be ſaved, by the ſame faith that we are. Conſider again, what the thief could know, when it was ſaid to him, <hi>this day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe:</hi> Or the <hi>Eunuch</hi> when <hi>Philip</hi> baptized him: Or that woman to whom, when ſhe had waſhed our Lords feet, it was ſaid, <hi>thy faith hath ſaved thee:</hi> Or ſhe that was waſted away by the bloody iſſue: or the Palſied man, with many others, whoſe ſins were forgiven them meerly upon their confeſſing the name of the Lord. It is alſo obſervable, what the reaſon ſhould be, that whereas theſe points which we have ſet down as neceſſary, are ſo frequently repeated in Scripture, and required of neceſſity to be known; thoſe points which ſome men ſo highly account of, are not in like manner required. If thoſe books had bin written by the wit of man, which we account (as indeed they are) ſacred,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:150539:55" rendition="simple:additions"/> we ſhould ſay that honeſt <hi>Homer</hi> had took a nap and forgot him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: But they are indicted by the Holy Spirit. This therefore is not come to paſſe by chance, but by the ſure counſell of God: who, had he intended that thoſe points ſhould have been of like eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he would at leaſt in ſome one place, plainly have ſignified his mind. Which ſince he hath not done, what is man that he ſhould be able to conjecture Gods mind? Theſe things ought not to be meaſured by our wit or judgment, but by the wiſdom of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto us from heaven: it alone muſt be regarded, what ever reaſon may dictate.</p>
            <p>But if ſo be any one ſhall erre in a point that ought neceſſarily to be known, and cannot be reduced to a right judgment, no man ought to queſtion but that ſuch a perſon may be juſtly condemned and caſt out of the ſociety of the godly. And that not only, if being admoniſhed, he ſhall go on to ſeduce others, but alſo though he will be ſilent: for what participation can the Church of God have with him unto whom eternal life is not promiſed? But if the point, about which ſome man erres, be not in the number of thoſe that muſt needs be known; in this caſe, I conceive we muſt uſe a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For if he that thinks amiſſe, and cannot be reduced, ſhall likewiſe endevour to ſeduce others, having been often admoniſhed to deſiſt; I ſee no reaſon but that he may and ought to be caſt out of the Congregation: For ſuch an one exceedingly offends the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: and though the matter be not of the greateſt weight, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes not, that the errour is not pernicious; for look how one point of knowledge ſprings from another, even ſo do errours ariſe of errours; and what is there, wherein the glory of God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, that ought not to be of great moment? But if ſo be he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce not others, ſo long as he holds thoſe points that are neceſſary to ſalvation, he may be yet in the number of brethren: What if they ſhal cut him off? They ſhall (as much as in them lyes) cut a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving member from the body of Chriſt, which were very unjuſt, neither is there any precept of God commanding ſuch a thing. And ſo much of a juſt and unjuſt judgment: Now let us conſider, for our orderly and juſt proceeding thereto, what we ought to do, and what to avoid.</p>
            <p>For the matter of tenets: if ſome very pernicious errours ariſe, there is nothing hinders, but that we may forthwith make head
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:150539:56"/> againſt it, and teach the people what a doctrine it is, that they may take heed of it. But the man is not to be caſt out, untill ſuch time as, according to the rule of the Goſpell, all courſes have been tried to reclaime him; and if we are forced to proceed to an ejection, we muſt be carefull that nothing be done, whereby any hinderance may ariſe to the Church. Now it is very clear, that by how much the greater ill-will any man ſhall bear towards the Church, by ſo much the more may the Church look to be moleſted by him, that he will more deſperately and eagerly plot againſt her, privily ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing al he can, and by calumnies endevouring to render the Church hatefull, and the like. Now by how much the more ſharply any man is dealt with, by ſo much the more will he be moved againſt the Church. In conſideration whereof, my judgment is, that the Heretique ſhall in ſuch ſort be condemned, as that the cauſe of his condemnation being ſimply ſignified, no kind of reproach be uſed, and that this be done with intimation rather of grief, then of any anger or hatred: in ſuch manner as the judgment may be full of gravity, but void of all paſſion and ſharpneſſe. But we have before ſpoken, when we handled the duty of a private man, that which is ſutable to the preſent occaſion, &amp; have ſhewed how alwayes more hurt then good comes by ſharp language. In a word, we muſt take heed leſt thoſe men arrogate unto themſelves to judge either of the doctrine, or of the man, unto whom it does not appertain. For, doubtleſſe it belongs not to any private perſon, nor yet to two or three, but to the whole Church. Let two or three Prophets ſpeak (ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>and let the rest judge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is the courſe the Church ought to take for the reſiſting the growth of errours: We are now to ſpeak of the Magiſtrates duty. An argument (if there be any) full of controverſie, intricate and of very great concernment. Such as cannot away with the doctrine received, be their judgment better, or be it worſe, find themſelves exceedingly grieved that they may not be ſuffered for to ſpeak their minds. On the other ſide, thoſe whoſe doctrine both the Magiſtrates and people approve, and alſo eſteem of their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; ſince they cannot without great grief, nor many times with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome diminiſhment of their reputation, heare controverſies daily raiſed; unto ſuch the uſe of the ſword cannot but ſeem very neceſſary to repreſſe ſuch as will not reſt content with the doctrine
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:150539:56"/> generally received; and it is commonly ſeen that as any thing is ſubſervient unto the intereſt of any perſons, ſuch perſons are ſoon perſwaded, that that thing is juſtly put in practiſe, Wherefore, ſince that a mans own commodity comming into conſideration, permits him not to judge ſo iuſtly as is fit, our thoughts muſt by all means poſſible be withdrawn from ſuch conſiderations; and if this be hard to be done, the next hereunto is, that in thought at leaſt every one change his own condition, and make himſelf of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, and ſo ſet himſelf to conſider both what may be moſt convenient to be done, and what is moſt agreeable to the Law of God. If therefore liberty or tolleration ſeem like to be convenient for thee: imagine thy ſelf to be in his condition who allowes of the doctrine received, and would have it preſerved, and that there are certain men who daily vex thee, men of no judgment, of no ſpirit, void of ſhame, making a perpetual noiſe, and exceſſively trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome; Taylors, Fiſher-men, Butchers, Cookes, ſilly women, confidently argue about the chief heads of Religion, meddle with every thing, call all into queſtion, deceive the ſimple, breed innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable ſcandals. Doubtleſſe if thou ſhalt (as we have ſaid) ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine thy ſelf to be in ſuch a condition; a thouſand to one, but thou wilt conceive that it is abſolutely neceſſary to bridle ſo great li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſſe. But if thou ſhalt afterwards caſt thine eye upon ſuch places of Scripture as are commonly believed to arme the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate againſt corrupters of religion, haply thou wilt much more be enclined ſo to think &amp; to judge that ſuch a courſe wil be very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. He which conceives the doctrine commonly received to be true and ſincere, and judges that it were wiſely done for the preſervation thereof, to put hereticks to death: let him think with himſelf, that it may notwithſtanding come to paſſe, that by little and little, while the paſtours ſlumber, the doctrine may be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and the Church degenerate from her ancient piety. For as ſoon as the Church obtains ſome ſhort peace and tranquillity, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline is ſlackened by little and little, piety growes cold, and a wonderfull forgetfulneſs of God and his Law creeps into the minds of men: which ingratitude ſince God cannot let go unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, he withdrawes his Spirit, and gives freer ſcope unto ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, by whoſe craft and ſubtilty it comes to paſſe, that, though the ſame doctrine ſeem to remain, yet it is by degrees changed and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:150539:57"/> corrupted; now, where it is grown into an uſe to decide contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies in Religion by the ſword, whatſoever doctrine in time to come ſhall be commonly received, whoſoever ſhall oppoſe that doctrine, be it right or wrong, he ſhall be accounted an heretick; and what ever texts of Scripture or arguments he ſhall alleage for himſelf, the hangman muſt be the only man that ſhall anſwer all. And ſo it will come to paſſe, that look what formerly was a juſt ſeverity, will be turned into a monſtrous and horrible cruelty. Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine thy ſelf therefore to have fallen into thoſe times, wherein it is unlawful, for ſuch as think aright, to oppoſe ſuch errors as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly received and if they ſhall dare ſo much as to mutter in the leaſt degree, the ſword, the gallowes, the faggot ſhall be at their heels: No place is allowed to plead their cauſe; and it ſhall come into thy mind, that ſuch great tyranny had its originall from the puniſhing of ſuch as were hereticks indeed; verily thou wouldſt rather wiſh that no heretick had ever been puniſhed, then that ſuch tyranny ſhould come into uſe. It is llkewiſe to be conſidered, how little oft-times the ſucceſſe of putting hereticks to death, anſwers the expectation of ſuch as practiſe it. For when a man underſtands that he cannot ſafely publiſh his opinion, he will not diſcover the ſame at all times, in all places, or to every one he meets with: but he will firſt try how they are affected, he will by little and little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate himſelf, and if he find himſelf miſtaken in the party, he will make triall elſe-where. But if he ſees, that eare is given to what he ſayes, he wil make his progreſſe by degrees, until he be wholly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the parties mind; and thus wil he practiſe with a ſecond, and a third; and ſuch as ſhal he make companions of his error, thoſe commonly he will make his partners in ſpreading the ſame abroad, corrupting others, and propagating the ſect; ſo that before the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate ſhall come to hear that one is ſeduced, ſometimes a great part of the people is miſ-led, and the wound become almoſt incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. And ſince theſe things are done privately, not ſo much as thoſe that are over the Crhurch can uſe the remedies proper to them, <hi>viz.</hi> the power of the Word: for though they hear ſome rumours, yet can they not diſtinctly underſtand what is done; what Arts the ſeducers uſe, with what arguments they preſſe their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, no man can relate. For, ſuch as ean, neither will nor dare; they that would, know them not, and for the moſt part relate only
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:150539:57" rendition="simple:additions"/> their own ſuſpicions or fictions: and ſuppoſe the Paſtors have ſome grounds to proceed upon; foraſmuch as they are exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hated by thoſe whom they ſhould heal, and lookt upon as ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, all their labour is loſt, eſpecially if (as is commonly ſeen) ſharp language and reproaches ſhall be added. Moreover, when Paſtors ſhall place their hope of prſereving their doctrine, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting heretiques by the ſword, and ſhall not ſee any great need of learning to that intent, they addict themſelves to idleneſſe, and ſo by degrees a generall ignorance followeth: ſo that Satan may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards eaſily obtrude any ſuperſtitions and errours. Neither is it lightly to be paſſed over, that forasmuch as it is commonly the lot of godly perſons to ſuffer perſecutions, reproaches and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for religions ſake, hereby, as by a moſt manifeſt token, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if with a couragious and cheerfull mind they undergo them, and their converſation be unblameable, they do exceedingly juſtifie their cauſe with ſimple people; whiles on the contrary part, thoſe from whom they ſuffer ſuch things, can hardly avoid the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of great injuſtice and tyrannicall cruelty. By which means it comes to paſſe, that many are daily exaſperated, confirmed in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and rendred wholly incurable. For we have too many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples before our eyes, which if any man ſhall diligently weigh, veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he will find ſmall cauſe much to deſire the uſe of the ſword, for the extirpatioh of hereſies. In a word, that thy judgment may be pure and ſincere, thou muſt bring thy ſelf to ſuch a paſſe, as not to deſire it may be ſo, rather then ſo: but this alone, which way ſoever the matter fall, which ſide ſoever prevaile, that ſuch tenets may be eſtabliſhed, as are agreeable with Gods Word, and make for his glory.</p>
            <p>Certain it is, that ſeducers were by the old Law puniſhed with death, and in caſe any City ſhould be drawn from the right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God to worſhip idols, the Law commanded that that City ſhould be deſtroyed and burnt up, never to be built again. But ſome ſuppoſe that Law was of force only untill Chriſt, and that it ought not to take place under the New Teſtament: the ground of their conjecture being this, that the Iſraelitiſh nation was a type of the Chriſtian Church, and that they had promiſes of earthly ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things, ſuch as were of uſe in this life, and that their ſacrifices were of the ſame ſtrain, and in a word, all their ſervices: which
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:150539:58"/> nevertheleſſe did ſignifie things inviſible appertaining to eternall life. Which being ſo, they collect, that that corporall puniſhment was likewiſe a type of eternall damnation; and that therefore this law, with all others ordained to figure out things to come, had an end at the comming of Chriſt: Which conjecture ſeems to me ſo probable, that I ſhould not tell how to reject it, did not the reaſon, in the Law ſet down, oppoſe the ſame. For thus it is in the Law: that all Iſrael hearing, may fear, and do no more ſo for the future. Which reaſon, truly, is alwayes of force: ſo that though the Law it ſelf be expired, yet the Magiſtrate hath as much authority to make another to the ſame purpoſe, as he hath authority to make lawes againſt murderers, adulterers, and other criminall offenders. Howbeit, the words of our Lord ſeem to perſwade the contrary, where he propounds the parable of the tares. For to the ſervants demanding whether they ſhould go and pluck up the tares, the houſholder is ſaid to have anſwered, <hi>that they ſhould not go, lest gathering the tares, they ſhould pluck up the Wheat.</hi> Which place whiles ſome interpret one way, and ſome another, we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how great a difference there is between gathering of teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Scripture to eſtabliſh an opinion which a man hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready fixed in his mind, and to make uſe of them meerly for the clearing of the truth. Now, the way to find out the truth, were, if when thou haſt found an expoſition which ſeems to make for thy opinion, thou ſhouldeſt aſſume the perſon of the party diſſenting, and diligently conſider what might be ſaid againſt it, and not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently applaud thy ſelf in thine own expoſition. Hence it would come to paſſe, that thoſe which diſſent ſhould not alwayes diſſent, but ſuch as erre would at laſt give way to them that judge aright. But for the moſt part, we care more for Victory then Truth. And foraſmuch as the ſolution of the queſtion in hand ſeems wholly to conſiſt in the expoſition of this text; we muſt beware again and again leſt intereſt blind our eyes, and that we beſtow not leſſe time and ſtudy in the examination thereof, then the cauſe requires. That expoſition truly which thoſe give, which ſay, that Chriſt doth not here exclude all rigour, but that he ſhews, ſuch evils are to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, which cannot without ſome great miſchief be corrected; ſeems not ſutable to the words of the Houſholder: for he doth not ſay, Come on, go your wayes and do it, but take heed leſt <hi>with the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:150539:58" rendition="simple:additions"/> tares you pluck up the Wheat;</hi> but he abſolutely forbids them to medle in the buſineſſe: and wills that both the tares and the wheat ſhould grow untill the harveſt. Whence it appears that great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is offred to the words by ſuch an expoſition. Neither do they ſeem to expound thoſe words more fitly, who affirme that they are to be underſtood of the univerſall purging of the Church, which our Lord would have deferred till the day of Judgment; not forbidding, in the mean time, the purging of particular Churches. Neither do I think it requiſite, we make any long enquiry, how truly the ſervants of the Houſholder are ſaid to mean the Angels; let us rather with attentive minds conſider what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t is which is forbidden: Hence we ſhall ſoon ſee who they are that are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Clear it is, that the Wheat is the godly, the tares the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but whether all kind of ungodly perſons, or ſome one ſort of them, we ſhall ſee hereafter. And the field is the world: To take therefore the tares out of the field, is to kill the ungodly, to pat them out of the number of thoſe that live in this world. But our Lord forbids that, and would have them grow with the Wheat untill the time of harveſt, and not ſeparated till then. But (thou wilt ſay) he forbids the purging and clenſing of the whole field, but not of particular Churches. Suppoſe then that men ſhall be ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in clenſing particular Churches, that none ſhall remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanſed, will not the whole become by that cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe cleanſed? But thou denyeſt that that can be done: yet ſuppoſe it may; thou muſt of neceſſity grant, that when every particular Church ſhall be clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the whole Church will be likewiſe pure, which being done before Harveſt time, would croſſe the wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l of the Lord; foraſmuch as, look what he would not have done before Harveſt, he wils as little that it ſhould be done by men, as by Angels. Now if ſo be any Magiſtrate ſhall go about to clenſe, not the whole Church which is not in his power, but that which he can, what other thing ſhall he do, but, as much as in him lyes, reſiſt the will of the Lord? And truly how ſmall ſoever the part clenſed ſhall be, it will be a part of the whole; ſo that he that ſhall do herein what he ſhal be able, it may well be ſaid, that if he might have had his will, the whole ſhould have been purged. By all which it appears, that this expoſition cannot be allowed. Others would have it, that it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbidden to pluck up the tares by war. But foraſmuch as the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:150539:59"/> words do as well expreſſe that way of plucking up the tares, when a particular perſon is cenſured and put to death, as that of pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up by war; he that would have the words of the Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder to be underſtood only of the former, bringing no ſure rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he ſo interprets, ought to be accounted a gueſſer rather then an expounder. For the words are to be taken according to their evident ſenſe, unleſſe ſome ſufficient reaſon do diſſwade: ſo as if they be generall, we muſt underſtand the ſpeech to be generall: if the Law diſtinguiſh not, we ought not to diſtinguiſh. How then ſhall we expound this Parable? Thoſe words (ſaiſt thou) <hi>Let both grow untill the Harveſt,</hi> cannot be underſtood according to the letter, that the wicked ſhould be ſuffered to grow as much as the godly: So far you and I are agreed. For I ſee what abſurdities would follow, if all the Magiſtrates authority, and all diſcipline were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. Howbeit, plain it is, that a certain kind of ungodly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are here intended, who though they may ſeem ſuch as ought to be cut off, yet it is forbidden them to whom that work ſhould belong, to cut them off. Now this cannot be underſtood of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, theeves, and other flagitious perſons, ſince its manifeſt that Magiſtrates are ordained by God, and are his Miniſters for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of evill doers, neither do they bear the ſword in vain: yea, though it ſhould appear that he which hath committed adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, murther, or other crime, were of the Wheat, by his notable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, the Magiſtrate is not therefore bound to ſpare him; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truly will any man in his wits deny, but that monſtrous wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſes ought to be reſtrained by the avengement of the ſword. And if ſo be the Parable cannot be meant of all ungodly perſons, it is neceſſary that thoſe whom it intend, sſhould be by ſome note of difference diſtinguiſhed from al other. Now from whence may this difference be rather taken, then from that thing wherein godly and ungodly perſons do moſt differ one from another? But, what is that? Is it not in the doctrine of Religion? with reſpect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the one ſort is called pious, the other impious. But there are two, kinds of impious perſons, for ſome are eſtranged from the true religion, both in name and in truth, as the worſhippers of Idols, and the <hi>Turks,</hi> but eſpecially Atheiſts: others, are in name and profeſſion Chriſtians, but in deed and in truth they are nothing ſo, their doctrine being corrupted with great and foule errours,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:150539:59" rendition="simple:additions"/> which kind of perſons we call Heretiques. The former ſort may again be divided into two parts. For ſome of them have never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the Chriſtian Religion others have Apoſtatized there-from. Since therefore we are to diſtinguiſh men according to their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, either we muſt hold that both theſe kind of ungodly perſons are meant in the Parable, or that one is underſtood: that we ſhould ſay both are underſtood, the words of the Parable give us little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement: for they ſpeak of ſuch ſeed as the enemy had ſown among the Wheat: ſo that it is manifeſt they mean ſuch kind of impious perſons as converſe among the godly, that is, the true Chriſtians, and adorn themſelves with the name of Chriſtians, of which kind are Heretiques. And this truly is very ſutable to the nature of tares: for they ſay that theſe tares are nothing but Wheat or Barly corrupted by the over-moiſture of the ſoile, and ſoaked with frequent rains; ſo that hereſie could not have been ſet forth by a more fit compariſon: ſo that this ſpeech is all one, as if the ſervants ſhould have asked their Lord, whether or no they ſhould kill Heretiques, and take them out of the way. That this expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is neither abſurd, nor unſutable, but rather the neceſſary inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the place, I conceive every one will perceive, that weighs the words with no other deſire but to find out the truth. The Enemy is ſaid to have ſown his own ſeed amongſt the good ſeed: among the ſeed (I ſay) which the Lord had ſown. Now the word, Seed, is taken ſometimes for that out of which any thing grows, (and this its proper acceptation:) ſometimes, but improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is taken for that which grows out of the ſeed. The ſeed which the Lord ſowed, to ſpeak properly, was the Goſpel which he preached, as it is taken in the Parable next before: but in a leſſe proper expreſſion, the ſeed are they that believed the Goſpell. So the Devils ſeed, ſpeaking properly, are falſe doctrines ſcattered amongſt Chriſtians, improperly the Devils ſeed are they who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace falſe doctrines. Now, that the faithfull are called the Lords ſeed, the ungodly the ſeed of the Devil, in reſpect of that ſeed from which their godlineſſe and ungodlineſſe ſprings, is clear, in as much as both the good and bad herbs are ſaid to have grown up after the ſowing of ſeed; and becauſe the ſervants wondred how the tares or cockle ſprang up, ſince there was none but good ſeed ſown, &amp; bad plants could not grow but from bad ſeed. So that it is
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:150539:60"/> manifeſt by what hath been ſaid, that by the tares none but Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques can be underſtood. The old Law then (wilt thou ſay) and its reaſon is abrogated, by this of our Lord. But what if, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that hath been ſaid, both Laws may be ſtill in force, and the latter derogate nothing from the former? It would (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) ſeem very ſtrange. But what if it may be ſo? And what is there that may be alledged why this expoſition ſhould not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as true? Come on then, let us examine whether this Law may ſtand with that of the Old Teſtament, though it forbid He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques to be killed. Now againſt whom was the Old Law given? verily againſt ſuch as either drew away others from the true God to worſhip Idols, or at leaſt being ſeduced themſelves, had forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him. But we do not terme ſuch offenders Heretiques, but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negadoes &amp; apoſtates; there is in that law no mention of hereticks But God (will you ſay) doth as much abhor that worſhip, which is not according to his own commandement, as he doth the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of other gods. Very well; ſuppoſe it: What will you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer? Doth it thereby appear, that the law which was made againſt Apoſtates, muſt be executed againſt Heretiques? An Heretique is not comprehended in the name or notion of an Apoſtate, neither is he mentioned in any other word of the Law. And if ſo be thou wilt needs draw the law to mean him, that canſt thou not do from the proper force of the words: But (as Lawyers ſpeak) by way of extenſion and large interpretation. But it would firſt be known, whether every Law will admit of ſuch extenſions, and if not every one, which may admit of them, and wherefore or upon what ground; and whether or no in this Law thoſe things are found, in regard of which an extenſion is to be made. Doubtleſſe, if thou ſhalt accommodate the Law to that which the words do not ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie; thou muſt do it only by a conjecture at the mind of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver. But, with what Law-giver art thou here to dealt? With ſuch an one verily, as at whoſe mind to gueſſe is the hardeſt thing in the world: So that all ſuch conjecturing cannot but be very doubtfull. And beſides, ſince there is extant a generall law, that forbids killing, we ſhould not come to the ſhedding of blood by the authority and warrant of a doubtful law, but of one very clear and plain. And all this difficulty would remain, though we could perceive no difference between the caſe of an Apoſtate, and that of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:150539:60" rendition="simple:additions"/> an Heretique. For we might juſtly ſuſpect, that, though we could not ſee it, there might yet be a wide difference. Neither ſhould we run head-long to make an extenſion of a law to take away a mans life. But what, if there are not wanting large differences by us diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemable? For an Apoſtate, doth not only forſake the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, but refuſes to give any credit to the Word of God: with an Heretique the Authority thereof remaineth firme: ſo that thou maiſt find other weapons wherewith to vanquiſh an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, beſides ſtones and ſwords; but other weapons wherewith to an Apoſtate, thou haſt none. In which reſpect peradventure it was, that God would by the moſt grievous puniſhment terrifie a man from al thought of forſaking his worſhip, and denying to give credit to his Word, and would not however that an Heretique ſhould be ſubject to like penalty. Hereunto may be added, that the Church reaps no benefit by Apoſtates, but by Heretiques much, eſpecially in this particular, that by means of the godly are provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked more ſeriouſly and diligently to ſearch the Scriptures, who would otherwiſe addict themſelves to ſloth, and by degrees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ignorant of all religion. But this is of greateſt weight, that the Magiſtrate cannot be ſo miſtaken, as to conceive that a man apoſtatizeth from the true religion, or ſollicites others to apoſtatize, that doth not ſo do; whereas he that erres not may eaſily ſeem to him to erre, or he that erres but a little, may eaſily ſeem to him to erre very grievouſly, which the many controverſies even amongſt the moſt learned, wherewith the Church is evermore exerciſed, do plainly prove. Now, when I ſay the Magiſtrate may erre in ſuch a caſe, I put no fault in the word of God, as if it were not clear and true, but in the Magiſtrate himſelf; in as much as he brings not ſuch inſtruction, nor ſuch a ſpirit to the interpretation thereof, as he ought to do. For how few of theſe men that exerciſe the office of Magiſtrates, though they profeſſe the Goſpell, do ſtudy the Scriptures as they ought to do? How few of them are eminent for piety and prudence? So that from them no other but a raſh and injuſt judgement, in a matter of this nature, is to be expected? But, you will ſay, the queſtion is not, whether every Magiſtrate have authority to proceed againſt ſuch as he ſhall account for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques; but the queſtion is of a truly pious and prudent Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and of ſuch as are Heretiques indeed. I heare what you ſay:
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:150539:61"/> But who is there bearing the ſword, that will not be accounted godly, and that will not account for an Heretique whoſoever thwarts him in matters of Religion? So that this will unavoyda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly follow, that, look what authority you allow a pious Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate againſt true Heretiques, that will every Magiſtrate uſurpe againſt every one that ſhal diffent from him, be his judgment what it will be. For as much therefore as we have ſhewed, that we might not ſafely make an extenſion of the Law, though we could obſerve no difference between an Apoſtate and an Heretique: What ſhall be done now we ſee ſo much difference? It is clear therefore from the premiſes, that the old Law remains in force, or that at leaſt the like may be renewed, and yet Heretiques are not to be put to death, foraſmuch as the caſe of an Heretique, and the caſe of an Apoſtate are different.</p>
            <p>But ſome may demand, whether or no it may then at leaſt be juſt to proceed againſt an Heretique when being commanded to be ſilent, he ſhall notwithſtanding go on to infect as many with his poiſon as he can? A queſtion of great concernment, in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution whereof to erre will be of dangerous conſequence, on which ſide ſoever the errour light. For if it be the will of God that Magiſtrates ſhould puniſh Heretiques that ſeduce; the reaſon is, becauſe it will make for the good of his Church, and for his own glory; ſo that if the Magiſtrate ſhall therein be negligent he will be lyable to under-go ſevere puniſhment from God: But if it be the will of God, that they ſhould not be puniſhed, doubtleſſe he hath weighty reaſons why they ſhould not: ſo that the Magiſtrate ſhall not croſſe his will without puniſhment. Wherefore it lies the Magiſtrate in hand to be very careful, that he go not about to gueſs at the mind of God by his own wit or judgment, but that he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the underſtanding thereof by a diligent ſearch and diſcuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods Word. And ſince it is clear, that by the tares is meant Heretiques, unleſſe ſomewhat elſe had been added, beſides the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding to kill Heretiques, the true way of interpretation, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to the ordinary manner of ſpeaking, would manifeſtly require, that we ſhould underſtand the Law (for ſo we would call the Houſholders forbidding to pluck up the Tares) to forbid the killing of Heretiques as Heretiques<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or becauſe they are Heretiques. As, if the Law ſhould forbid to kill a theefe, we would underſtand,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:150539:61" rendition="simple:additions"/> that the Law forbids that he ſhould be killed for his theft. But in caſe any man, beſides his being an Heretique, would teach contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Magiſtrates command, the words of the Law ſo interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, would not ſeem to ſave him harmleſſe; as in caſe a man ſhould to his theft add murther, that law which forbids the putting a theef to death would not ſave him. But the reaſon and cauſe is added, why the Father of the Family wouid not have the tares pluckt up, <hi>viz.</hi> left with the tares the wheat alſo ſhould be pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, leſt with Heretiques ſuch ſhould be killed as are not Heretiques, but the ſons of God. Out of this reaſon therefore, we muſt fiſh for the right interpretation of the Law. Now the moſt Interpreters conceive that the danger of the miſtake in killing a child of God for an Heretique, lies here, in that he who is an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retique to day, may hereafter, if he live, repent: and that this is the reaſon they are not to be killed; which opinion I conceive is well refuted by ſuch as ſay, that if heed were to be taken unto ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, it ought to be as much reſpected in that old Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Apoſtates, and ſuch as draw men from the worſhip of the true God, as in this new Law. And ſince there was no conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had of ſuch repentance in the old Law, it is like there was none had in this. Whereunto may be added, that he that is to day an Heretique: If he be in the number of Gods Elect, he cannot be put to death: but that all that is neceſſary to be known to ſalvation ſhall be revealed to him before: if he be none of Gods Elect, there remaines no hope of his repentance. So that this ſeems no juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why an Heretique ſhould not be put to death. Now, unleſſe there be a reſpect had unto the repentance of an Heretique, there is no other danger to be feared, but this, that the Magiſtrate may at one time or another, account him for an Heretique that is not an Heretique, either becauſe not he but the Magiſtrate is in the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, or if he be in the errour and not the Magiſtrate, the errour is not ſo great that he ought therefore to be accounted an Heretique. And if this be that which the Houſholder, <hi>viz.</hi> our Lord aimed at, verily he hath peremptorily declared that Magiſtrates are no fit Judges of doctrines; and hath forbidden them to exerciſe any ſuch juriſdict on. But if any man ſhall ſtil contend, that reſpect was had to the repentance of the party erring, yet ſhall he not thereby be able to prove, that no conſideration was had of that other reaſon,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:150539:62"/> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> the poſſibility of miſtaking one that is no heretick for an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. The Law forbids hereticks to be kild, leſt that with the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks be kild, ſuch as are not hereticks. By what way or means ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſoever it may come to paſſe that the one be kild in ſtead of the other, that way or means may be ſaid to belong unto the Law, as a reaſon thereof. The Law ſpeaks generally without diſtinction: ſo that hew<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> wil take upon him to diſtinguiſh, not having a manifeſt reaſon to warrant him; ſeems to be a gueſſer rather then an expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor, and cannot avoid the imputation of Raſhneſſe. For as much (I ſay) as the Law ſpeaks generally without any diſtinction, it muſt be generally underſtood without making any differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He that ſhall take ſo much liberty unto himſelf, as raſhly at his own pleaſure to invent diſtinctions, cannot be ſaid to expound, but by a cunning kind of cavillation to go about to evade the words of the Law. In which reſpect, and conſidering the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, we muſt conclude, that whether the matter of repentance were conſidered or not; yet that there was regard had to that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Magiſtrate, whereby he might at one time or another put to death for hereſie him that is no Heretique; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that judgments of this nature pertain not to the Magiſtrate, nor to any Men, but to the Son of God alone, who <hi>at the last day by his Angels will ſeparate the tares from the wheat, and cast them into the Fire.</hi> Now, if ſo be the Magiſtrate be not a fit judge to diſcern between him that is an Heretique, that he may kil him, and him that is not an Heretique, that he may ſpare him; how can he be fit to judge between a ſufficient cauſe to make an Heretique, that is to ſay, an hereticall tenet, ſo as that he may under a penalty forbid the ſame to be taught, and an unſufficient cauſe or tenet not hereticall, ſo as that he may allow the ſame? For what is it to know an heretick, but to know the cauſe which makes an heretick? What other thing is it to err in the knowing of an heretick; but to err in the knowledg of the cauſes for which men are to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Heretiques? But let us look into the buſineſſe a little more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly. For it is certainly manifeſt from the words of the Houſe-holder, that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded his ſervants not to pluck up the tares, &amp;c. that he gave this command not for the ſake of the tares, but of that corn which through error might be taken for tares. For his wil was (to ſpeak plainly) that true Hereticks ſhould be ſpared, that by this
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:150539:62" rendition="simple:additions"/> means the ſafety of the true ſerva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God might be provided for. He denied unto pious &amp; prudent Magiſtrates the power of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heretiques, leſt by their example ungodly and Imprudent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates ſhould abuſe the ſaid power againſt the pious ſervants of God. For as much then as, that Law was made for the ſake of Gods pious ſervants, leſt at any time by a perverſe erroneous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they ſhould be put to death as Heretiques: We muſt take heed how we allow of any ſuch interpretation thereof; as that, whiles the Magiſtrate ſhall in all appearance be obedient unto the Law, the Law-giver ſhall notwithſtanding miſſe of his end for which he made the Law. But if ſo be, the Magiſtrate ſhall ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the Law, as to conceive, that he ought indeed to ſpare He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques that keep their hereſies unto themſelves, and endevour not to perſwade others to imbrace them; but that he ought to put them to death, if they will teach their errours; ſhall the ſafety of the godly be by this means provided for and ſecured? Surely no. For Laws of Magiſtrates with ſuch a <hi>Proviſo,</hi> as often as the truth ſhal, come to be called hereſie, will be the death of Gods ſervants: For to whomſoever the truth ſhall be by God revealed, he ought not to bury his talent in the earth, that is to ſay, he ought not by ſilence to diſſemble the truth to him revealed: But Gods will is, that it ſhould be acknowledged before the ſons of Men and revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. So that it cannot otherwiſe fall out, but that, if the Magiſtrate ſhall, account ſome good and faithfull ſervant of God for an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique; he not withſtanding any penalty denounced, will endevou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to perſwade as many as he can, of the truth of that doctrine which the Magiſtrate accounts hereſie. Whence it wil come to paſſe, that whereas the Law was made for the good of ſuch perſons, none ſhall receive leſſe advantage thereby then they. It muſt be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded therefore, that this interpretation can be no wayes agreeable to the intent of the Law-maker, but rather that it is moſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereunto. Yet is it not my intent, that godly Magiſtrates ſhould carry no ſtroke in the Kingdom of Chriſt: many other things there are, which they both may and ought to do: As to puniſh irreverent ſpeeches againſt God, to puniſh ſuch as forſake the whole Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an religion, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uch as dare to perſwade others to forſake the ſame. If any externall worſhips are ſet up, any Images erected, theſe they ought to aboliſh; to keep off the violence and injuries of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:150539:63"/> impious perſons from the heads of the godly; to maintain pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique peace and tranquility, is their duty, and ſuch like. But for them to aſſume unto themſelves to be judges of the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of ſuch men, as ſubmit themſelves to the Authority of Gods Word, and make uſe of the Teſtimonies thereof; they ſhall do well to weigh ſeriouſly what it is which they aſſume, and how great a liberty they allow unto themſelves. Some there are that ſuppoſe, in caſe the ſword ſhall not be unſheathed, all Religion wil ſoon be loſt: how beit we ſhal much wrong our Lord, if we ſuſpect that he is aſleep, that he cares not at all for his people, or that he cannot preſerve his own Goſpell without the ſword; as if the Word had no mettle or force, but that all a Chriſtians hope were placed in the ſword. For if, after that Satan by his inchantments had poſſeſſed the world, and himſelf was become Lord and Ruler; the power of Gods Word was ſuch, that it was able to caſt Satan out of his ſtrong and exquiſitely-fortified king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; ſhall it not be able to defend the Kingdom of Chriſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the blunted and broken darts of Satan? Let us be of good courage; our Lord doth not ſleep but watch. If we ſhall put al our confidence in him, if we ſhall fight with his Word, if being acted by his Spirit (whom we muſt obtain by continuall pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) we ſhall diligently and prudently avoyd all thoſe policies of Satan, of which we have hitherto treated; verily there will be no cauſe why we ſhould be afraid of heretiques; let but truth warily enter the combate with Impoſture, and ſhe muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity at laſt obtain the victory. Wherefore, if there ſhal dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear ſuch as move new queſtions, raiſe new controverſies, bawle at the Paſtors, bark at them, and moleſt them: let them think thus with themſelves: What is Satans drift in all thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>? Sure he comes in oppoſition of the truth of the Goſpell; but is that all he aimes at? What if ſo be that this be his aime, and ſome other greater thing be alſo by him endevoured? Namely (and that with thy aſſiſtance) that he may lay the foundations of ſuch a tyranny, as he intends, when time ſhall be, to exerciſe againſt the ſervants of God, wholly to extinguiſh the Goſpel with the profeſſors thereof, and to make himſelf abſolute Lord of the world. Come on then, what wilt thou that boaſteſt of thy care of Gods honour, do in ſuch a caſe? Thou that pretendeſt ſo
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:150539:63" rendition="simple:additions"/> much to prize the truth of the Goſpell, that wouldſt be thought to regard nothing but the good of the Church of God? What wilt thou (I ſay) do in this caſe? Wilt thou go and joyn forces with Satan? wilt thou hire thy ſelf to ſerve him, wilt thou ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply him with tools, ſtones and morter for his building? Wilt thou moile and ſweat at the ſame work with the drudges and ſlaves of Satan? wilt thou in good deed, that thou maiſt avoid ſome momentany ſhort troubles, aſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t Satan to lay the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo great a miſchief? what if this likewiſe be by him aimed at, even to wreath out of thy hands thoſe weapons which he moſt dreads, and to put thee upon the uſe of ſuch as he fears not a jot, yea, rather which he wholly contemns? Now, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all queſtion, he cares not a ruſh for ſwords and ſuch like terrible tooks; there is nothing which he more fears, and which he is leſſe able to reſiſt then the Word of God. But as ſoon as the Miniſters ſhal have obtained thus much, that whoſoever ſhal dare to mutter any thing againſt their doctrine, the Executioner ſhall preſently be called for, which by his halter or Ax alone ſhal reſolve all doubts, and unty all knots; what great ſtudy of the Scripture will they then uſe? Doubtleſſe they will plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that they have ſmall need ſo to ſpend their time. For they ſhall be able to obtrude upon the poor ſilly people, any thing they can but dream of, and yet nevertheleſſe maintain their dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and reputation. Wo be to us and to our Poſterity, if we ſhall caſt away this weapon wherewith alone we are allowed to fight; wherewith fighting we are alwayes ſure of victory. But ſuch (will you ſay) is the troubleſomneſſe and impudency of ſome perſons, ſo inſufferable, that they muſt of neceſſity be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained with other kind of weapons, beſide the Word. Shal I tel thee what I think of this ſpeech of thine. It is juſt as if ſome ſouldier, preſuming to excell all others in military valor, ſhould ſay, that his enemy fights ſo eagerly, ſo ſtoutly, that he muſt of neceſſity throw away his weapons, and become ſubject unto him. Oh gallant Soldier! What elſe, I pray you, is Satans ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor: what would he rather employ himſelf about, then to excite the wickedneſſe of men, to provoke the ſervants of God, with the higeſt hand of provocation poſſible? Now, if they ſhall ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly proſecute the work of Satan, ſhal we likewiſe do that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:150539:64"/> which he moſt of all deſires. This is it which Satan mainly ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, even to wreſt away the weapon of the Word from us, and that we may deſcend into the liſts aga nſt him, armed with ſuch kind of Ammunition, as he ſlights and contemnes. Shall we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becauſe Satan labours with might and main to this effect, and brings into the field the fitteſt ſoldiers for ſuch a purpoſe: Shal we, I ſay, ſubmit unto his wil, and caſting away thoſe weapons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with alone we may win the field; ſhall we catch hold of ſuch weapons, wherwith we ſhall ſoon be put to the worſe, and which will be turned to our own throats? Nay, but let us hold faſt this weapon of the Word of God: Let us fight with this alone, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with alone let us do our endevour to ſlay Satan himſelf, and all his Emiſſaries. Let us endevour to learn all the moſt convenient ways of ſtriking and warding with this weapon; all the Arts of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and defence: Of which matter we have already ſufficiently diſcourſed.</p>
            <p>And, as it is a thing not appertaining to the Magiſtrate, to make himſelf Judge of doctrines, and to uſe violence towards the Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, much leſſe does it belong to him to uſe ſuch violence, at the diſcretion, and upon the judgement of others. As in caſe he ſhould commit the care of Religion to certain perſons, and be ready him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to draw the ſword againſt whomſoever they ſhall perſwade him, or ſhould arme them to the ſame effect. How well he wil be able to juſtifie his ſo doing to the King of Kings in that day, which will be very terrible to the wicked, and joyfull to the godly, we may thus judge. Suppoſe thou thy ſelf being a King, and to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a far Country, ſhouldſt commit the care of thy Kingdom, Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and all thy affairs to the fidelity of one of thy ſervants; and he ſhould delegate the adminiſtration of all to ſome other ſervants, ſuch as came next to hand, of whoſe wiſdom and faithfulneſſe he had no aſſurance; yea, or to the fitteſt that he could chuſe; him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the mean ſeaſon being buſied about matters of the ſmalleſt concernment; and when all were like to miſcarry, he ſhould ſuffer the ſame courſe to be continued: when thou ſhouldeſt come home and take knowledg hereof; couldſt thou poſſibly allow of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of that ſervant of thine? For though thou ſhouldſt find all ſafe and well, wouldeſt thou not ſo account of that ſervant, as if all things had fallen out croſſe and contrary? But what if ſome very
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:150539:64"/> great damage, ſome ſhameful miſcarriage had happened? Of how great puniſhment wouldſt thou judg that ſervant to be worthy? And is not the Church of God Gods Kingdom, his Inheritance, his Delight and Joy? Is not all the dignity and comelineſs of the Church placed in the purity of her Doctrine, and the framing of her Worſhip, according to the Word of God? And what is there in the Adminiſtration of a Kingdom, which in compariſon here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, is not a very light thing, and of no account? Go to then, how canſt thou know that any man is of a right judgment in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Religion, ſo as that thou mayeſt ſafely commit thy ſword unto his care and truſt, unleſs thou thy ſelf ſhalt firſt of all declare, what is to be held therein. But if thou ſhalt commit affairs of ſuch moment to their fidelity and diſcretion, whoſe inner parts thou doeſt not know: yea, if thou ſhalt commit them to whomſoever, and thy ſelf minde other matters, what account wilt thou give of thine adminiſtration? Eſpecially, if while thou ſhalt be naping, and nothing minding any ſuch matter, pious doctrine ſhall be ſuppreſſed as impious, and impious doctrine ſhall be eſtabliſhed for pious: ſo that thence will follow the ſlaughter of many godly perſons taken for hereticks, and the perdition of an innumerable company of people by falſe doctrine; which people the Son of God made ſuch reckoning of, that he ſtuck not to lay down his life for them: how ſevere thinkeſt thou ſhall thy ſentence be? verily this is my judgment: Whatſoever does any way concern the glory of God, be it, that the liberty of hereticks in ſpreading falſe doctrines is to be reſtrained, or any other thing (as far as the nature of thy office may require or permit thee to act) that cannot be by thee omited without a great fault; yet will the fault be a thouſand times greater, if thou ſhalt therein make uſe of another mans knowledg, rather then thy ſelf to uſe all means poſſible to underſtand what ought to be done; and if thou canſt not be ſatisfied in thine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, it will be, by much, the ſafeſt way to interpoſe no authority of thine in ſuch a buſineſs, either by thy ſelf, or by others. Now, by what more clear example could Magiſtrates poſſibly have been admoniſhed, to confide in no mans judgment, then this, in that the Son of God himſelf by ſuch negligence of the Magiſtrate, was given up to the judgment, or luſt rather of his moſt unjuſt enemies? Take ye him (ſays <hi>Pilate</hi>) and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:150539:65"/> to your law judg him. Take heed thou think not thus with thy ſelf: We live now in a moſt clear light of the Goſpel: now the Paſtors are moſt holy: now all is ſafe. What? ſhall we think that Satan ſnorts and ſleeps? And to attempt nothing whereby to lay the foundation of ſome new Kingdom, whereby to erect ſome new tyrannies; to hatch ſome new Monſters? Now that is a known ſaying, That a ſmall Error at the begining, in the end comes to be of the firſt magnitude: And inaſmuch, as all things of this nature are of very great moment, whatſoever buſineſs ſhall offer it ſelf, I would exhort the Magiſtrate, That he would by moſt fervent prayers ask counſel of him who can never deceive, and act nothing unleſs he were aſſured that he were in the right. And in caſe after all, he ſhall be of this judgment, to think he ought to preſcribe what doctrines ought to be taught, and what not; he muſt at leaſt be very wary, leſt Satan do here gain upon him, either by making him to put his own opinion at ſuch a diſtance from the Hereticks, that while he ſhun <hi>Charybdis,</hi> he fall into <hi>Scylla;</hi> or to allow the Heretick ſomewhat which ought not to be granted; or to uſe ſuch words and phraſes, as may occaſion ſome new doctrine, himſelf intending no ſuch matter; or to eſtabliſh that doctrine as neceſſarily to be believed, which himſelf hath by neceſſary conſequence, to his thinking, drawn from the Scripture, there being, in the mean time, ſome error in his collection or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. And to the end, that he may not incur any of thoſe errors or the like, let him examine, how far he is aſſured of the truth of every point, by ſuch ways as we formerly delivered. Furthermore, it ſeems to me an excellent Caution, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall be laid down as agreeable to the Word of God, may be expreſſed with the ſame words and phraſes which the Spirit of God uſes in the Scriptures. Otherwiſe, it is almoſt impoſſible, but that the wit of man will intrude ſome thing of its own; which if it do, an error is committed almoſt incurable. And heed muſt be taken, that the Heretick be not declared to hold, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to teach any other thing, then what he holds and teaches for the avoiding of ſuch inconveniences as we have before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted.</p>
            <p>One thing there is, which verily I could never underſtand but to be altogether void of reaſon; That he who is thought to have
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:150539:65" rendition="simple:additions"/> taught ſomething falſe and impious, ſhould be forced to recant, which if he do, he ſhall not be puniſhed. To what purpoſed, I pray you, ſerves this practiſe? What good is there gotten; if for the avoiding of puniſhment, againſt his conſcience, an heretick ſhall recant his opinion? There is onely one thing that may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged for it, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſuch as are poſſeſſed with the ſame error and unknown perhaps, will do the like in their own hearts, yea, will counſel others to do the ſame. That opinion muſt needs have a very light impreſſion, which can ſo eaſily be plucked out of mens mindes. Have we no reaſon to ſuſpect, that ſuch a recantation is rather for fear of puniſhment, then from the heart? Will there not rather much heart-burning by this means ariſe, if the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ſhall ſeem not onely to kill the body, but to plot the ruine of the ſoul? Are we indeed ſo ill furniſhed with weapons to vanquiſh errors, as to be forced to defend our ſelves with a lye, to put our truſt in Recantations feigned through fear? But ſome may ſay: This is not that which we deſire, to force men to any kinde of Recantation; but that an heretick may acknowledg his error not ſo much with his mouth, as with his heart: this were excellent indeed, if thou couldſt bring him to it. But what work is there for threats or blandiſhments in this caſe? Theſe have ſome power indeed to prevail with the will. But thy buſineſs is with the Underſtanding, it is changed neither by threats, nor flatteries or allurements. Theſe cannot cauſe that, what formerly ſeemed true, ſhould now ſeem falſe, though the party may very much deſire to change his judgment. Which if it ſeem a new and wonderful thing to thee: I ſhall not need many Arguments to convince thee of the truth thereof. You ſuppoſe, that a man may change his judgment when he will, without any new reaſon to perſwade him to think otherwiſe: I deny that he can ſo do. Make you therefore an experiment upon your ſelf, and ſee if you can for the leaſt ſpace of time draw your ſelf to think otherwiſe then you do in the queſtion between us, ſo as to make your ſelf beleeve as I do, That a man cannot change his judgment when he pleaſes: without queſtion you ſhall finde that you cannot do it. But take heed you miſtake not an imagination for a perſwaſion; for nothing hinders, but that thou mayeſt imagine what thou wilt. I pray thee likewiſe to conſider again, That in caſe thou fear any thing, as for
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:150539:66"/> example, leſt ſome buſineſs may not have a good iſſue, leſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould come to paſs much againſt thy minde, ſo that thou canſt not ſleep for the trouble thereof: thou need but change thine opinion concerning ſuch a thing, ſo as to hope that all will be well, and thy trouble ſhall be at an end. O moſt eaſie and ready medicine, to take away the greateſt part of that trouble of minde which men ſuſtain in this life! O ſhort Philoſophy! If whatſoever evil a man ſhall fear may betide him, he may believe (if he will) that it will not come to paſs: whatſoever moleſts a man becauſe he takes it to be evil (when as oft-times there is no evil in ſuch a thing;) he may perſwade himſelf when he pleaſes, that it is not evil. But experience ſhews that none of theſe things can be done. Wherefore, if an heretick cannot, though he would, caſt away his error, unleſs reaſon compel him: why trouble you the poor wretch, to make him lye, and ſo to offend God, yet more and more? Verily, it cannot be denyed, but this was the devils inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby he might compel the ſervants of God, for fear of puniſhments to renounce Chriſt. So that I wonder ſome men could not perceive as much, though otherwiſe wiſe enough. How much better would it be, in caſe there were no queſtion, but that a man might be put to death for matter of Religion; to deal with him according to Law, whether he recant or recant not, neither to invite him, ſo much as by a word, to a Recantation, any otherwiſe then that he may be won to the truth, and his ſoul ſaved: which alſo were to be done not by threatnings, allurements, or through hope, but by the power of Scripture and Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>But as for the authority of the Magiſtrate, herein it is moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, not to ſuffer immodeſty, or delight to rail and reproach, to eſcape unpuniſhed, in whomſoever they ſhall be found. If a man muſt needs hear a reproach, let him hear it where he may make anſwer, and judicially defend himſelf; otherwiſe, the life and name of a man, his converſation and reputation, ought to be out of the danger of any mans tongue, or pen. If there be controverſies in Religion, let them contend on both ſides with Scriptures and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, but let the Magiſtrates look to it again and again, that they may under a penalty abſtain from whatſoever may tend to provoke one another. This, if they ſhall do, they ſhall both render
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:150539:66"/> the Church very quiet, and obtain great praiſe from all diſcreet perſons. And thus much ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoken of that change of judgment, concerning the doctrine of Religion, in which, they that have imbraced errors, know indeed that they have altered their judgment, but think withal, that they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to the better; onely, the adverſaries know that it is to the worſer part. We ſhall now diſcourſe, how it may come to paſs, that the true doctrine may be adulterated, and we never obſerve ſo much: and by what means we may prevent the ſame.</p>

               <p>HOw Doctrine may be corrupted, and yet no change appear. The needleſs multiplication of doctrines cauſed through the curioſity of Teachers, is a great means: ſo is the negligence and ignorance of the people, truſting too much to their Paſtors. A double Caution to be uſed: That no change be made in Doctrine, when it is pure: That in caſe any change happen, it may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. An excellent way to keep doctrine pure, is to avoid all curious and vain queſtions; to have the ſcope of Religion always in our eye; and to expreſs the doctrine thereof in the phraſe of Scripture. To diſcover whether there hath been a change made, we muſt compare the doctrine of our times, not with that of our Predeceſſors and Anceſtors, but with the doctrine taught in the times of the Apoſtles. Man would always ſeem more wary and wiſe then God, in expreſsing the points of Religion. The people muſt frequently be admoniſhed, That the care of Religion, and reading the Word, belongs not to Paſtors alone, but to every one that intends to be ſaved.

            <p>WHen the Doctrine of Religion ſhall be depraved; that yet no change be diſcernable, there are many cauſes; of which ſome are in the doctrine it ſelf, others in the manner of the mutation: Some reſpect thoſe which teach, others thoſe which are taught. In the doctrine it ſelf, there ſeem to be theſe: Firſt, that it is an heap, as it were, of many things very unlike one to the other, like ſo many grains, ſo that a change may be made by the ſmalleſt parts. For look, as if out of ſome great heap thou ſhalt daily take certain grains, and put others in their rooms, the heap will ſeem to continue as it was, though by little and little it be changed, and begin to be another kinde of heap from what it was; even ſo, foraſmuch as the doctrine of Religion conſiſts of many ſentences and doctrines very unlike one to the other, though conſpiring together, and tending to the ſame end: Whiles now this doctrine, now that, ſhall be changed and corrupted, the body of doctrine it ſelf (that I may ſo ſpeak) ſeems to retain the ſame figure, though it be not indeed the ſame, but in part altered. Yea verily, one onely ſentence may be of ſuch weight, that it being
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:150539:67"/> depraved and altered, though no ſuch thing appear, the whole doctrine of Religion may notwithſtanding be by that means cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted: Foraſmuch as without that ſentence, all the reſt of the doctrine may become unprofitable, and of no value. Such an one is that ſentence, that, <hi>By the blood of Chriſt alone ſhed for us, and his ſacrifice offered for our ſalvation upon the Croſs, all our ſins are expiated;</hi> which ſentence, if thou ſhalt ſo change, as to ſay, That our ſins are done away by the merits of our good works, or the interceſſion of Saints, of a Chriſtian doctrine, thou wilt make one altogether Antichriſtian. Neither is the doctrine of Religion, in regard that it conſiſts of divers unlike parts, ſubject to ſecret mutation, onely by changing and depraving the ſentences as we have ſaid, but alſo by adding ſome ſentences, and taking away others. I do not ſay, that this depravation can be made ſecretly in ſuch maner, as to corrupt the Scriptures. For if that were done, the deceit would be manifeſt: But that in ſpeaking and writing, falſe ſentences may be uttered inſtead of true, and depraved ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences inſtead of ſuch as are incorrupt. Now by how much the heap ſhall be greater, by ſo much the harder it will be, in caſe there ſhall be a change, to obſerve the ſame. In which reſpect, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of the doctrine helps much to hide any mutation in the ſame. Now the doctrine of Religion is inlarged, whiles it is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly handled, whiles it is drawn forth into many different queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which ſprout one out of another, and are propagated infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The cauſe of which miſchief is the over-great curioſity of men, their raſhneſs, arrogance and ambition; with which diſeaſes of the minde being madded, we muſt print and publiſh whatever we dream of. Yea verily, if we want matter to write, we unrip other mens diſcourſes, and ſew them together after a new faſhion; and had rather do that which is done to our hand, then be thought to do nothing. Now this is a thing which tends much to the hiding of corruption of doctrine, when as thoſe falſe ſentences which ſhall be put into the place of the true, ſhall have the appearance and ſhew of truth, though indeed they are far from any acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance therewith. Which is occaſioned divers ways. The firſt is, when ſome true ſentence in Scripture ſhall be expreſſed in ſuch words, as admit divers interpretations, which cannot all be true, and another ſentence ſhall be compoſed, agreeable to thoſe words
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:150539:68"/> miſunderſtood; for by this means, while a very different thing is ſpoken, the ſame thing which is in the Text, ſeems to be ſaid without any change. In like maner, when a Text is figurative, ſo that one thing is meant indeed, another thing ſeems to be meant, and a man ſhall take it in the ſeeming ſenſe without any regard to the figure. As if a man ſhould ſay, That in caſe any mans ſight be an occaſion of ſining, he ought to pluck out his eyes, and wholly bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nde himſelf, becauſe it is written, <hi>If thine eye ſhall offend thee, pluck it out, and caſt it from thee.</hi> For theſe words do at the firſt ſight ſeem to ſay as much, whereas their ſenſe is very different, <hi>viz.</hi> Whatſoever may ſlacken or ſtop a mans progreſs in the way of the Goſpel, he ought to abandon that thing forthwith; for that it is better to be without that thing then being thereby hindered in ſuch a courſe, to loſe the Kingdom of Heaven, and to be adjudged to eternal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. In like manner; if, when the meaning of a Text ſhall be according to the letter, the words are ſo expounded, as if they meant otherwiſe. As is practiſed upon theſe words, <hi>Go and ſhew thy ſelf unto the Priest,</hi> from which, this ſentence is drawn, <hi>Every man muſt confeſs his ſins to a Prieſt.</hi> Another means whereby a falſe ſentence ſeems to be true, is, when in the true ſentence there is ſomewhat contained, either expreſly or implici ely, and the falſe ſentence ſhall be expreſſed in ſuch terms, as exclude that thing ſo contained. (The thing we ſpeak of, ſo contained, is either an exception, or a condition, or a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, or ſome explanat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on.) Or ſome condition or expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, ſuiting not with the Text, ſhall be added. Thoſe words of the Apoſtle, have queſtionleſs an exception or a condition, <hi>Be not deceived, neither whoremongers, nor idolaters ſhall attain the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> for we muſt underſtand that condi ion, unleſs they repent. Now if any man ſhould ſay, That the ſin of uncleanneſs could not be pardoned, he ſhould ſpeak that which were agreeable to the words indeed, but far from the ſcope and purpoſe of that Text. In l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ion, <hi>The condition of man and beaſt is the ſame,</hi> as theſe did, ſo do they, both die alike, neither is a man better then a beaſt. Now the expoſition to be underſtood is, that thus it is not abſolutely, but for ought which a mans
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:150539:68"/> reaſon can obſerve to difference them. Which expoſition being excluded, he that ſhall preſs the words of <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſhall pluck up all Religion by the roots. Thoſe add unto the true ſentence of Scripture, who ſay, That thoſe ſhall obtain eternal life, who believe that their ſins are forgiven for Chriſts ſake, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they ſhall recount all their ſins unto the Prieſt, and obtain abſolution from him. He changes ſomewhat of the true ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, who ſays, That the Law is therefore holy, becauſe the knowledg thereof makes a man holy: for it is not therefore holy, but becauſe it makes a man to deſpair of his own ſtrength, and brings him unto Chriſt, the onely means of ſalvation, and becauſe it ſhews what things pleaſe or diſpleaſe God; to the end, we may worſhip him, not after our own inventions and conſtitutions, but according to his command. A third means, whereby a falſe ſentence is thruſt into the doctrine of Religion, appearing to be true onely, inſtead of that which is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, is, when from ſome true ſentence a falſe one is by a wrong inference collected, which collection ſhall be uſed in place of the true one, from which it was drawn. So, when the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath gathered out of thoſe words, <hi>Whatſoever thou ſhalt binde on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven, and whatſoever ſhall be looſed by thee on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven:</hi> this ſentence, That he hath power to make new laws, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute new heads of doctrine, or as they call them, new articles of Faith, and to compel men to keep and obſerve the one, and to believe the other: This collection or inference of his, he makes account of, as of a ſentence of Scripture. Now there is a kinde of falſe inferences or collections, very hidden and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure; foraſmuch, as they are partly drawn from ſuppoſitions, which are neither expreſſed, nor perhaps once thought of by the collectors; yet are ſuch collections admited without any queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, even as if they did ariſe out of moſt certain and clear grounds. This may be ſeen in that collection we laſt named: For, that it may be infered, That power to make laws was given to <hi>Peter,</hi> it is requiſite, that the word <hi>binde</hi> ſhould ſignifie to make laws: For ſo you ſhall rightly collect; to binde is to make laws, power of binding is given to <hi>Peter,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of making laws: In like maner you may collect; to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:150539:69"/> looſe, is to repeal laws: now power to looſe, was given to <hi>Peter;</hi> therefore, power to abrogate laws was given to him. And ſince it is ſaid, Whatſoever thou ſhalt bind and whatſoever thou ſhalt looſe, it will follow, that <hi>Peter</hi> may make or revoke what laws he pleaſe; yea the Ten commandmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s he may abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, if he think fit: Again, That all this may appear to belong to the Pope: another ſuppoſition muſt be made, <hi>viz.</hi> Whatſoever authority was given to <hi>Peter,</hi> the ſame is given to the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop; ſince therefore <hi>Peter</hi> had authority giv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n him to make or abrogate what laws he pleaſe, the ſame authority is given to the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop. But this concluſion is infered, without any mention of thoſe ſuppoſitions; That to binde, and to looſe, is to make, and revoke laws; and that Whatever authority was given to <hi>Peter,</hi> is given to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> Neither is every man able to mark in the making of ſuch collections, what that is which is omited and paſſed over with ſilence, as out of all queſtion true, though it be indeed as falſe as falſe may be. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, eaſie it is for any to underſtand, That the obſcurity of ſentences or doctrines of Religion, is a cauſe, that if any mutation be made, it cannot eaſily be diſcerned. Now the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of Chriſtian doctrine, ſprings from theſe grounds. Firſt, becauſe it handles the things of the ſpirit, and therefore cannot be underſtood without the ſpirit: which ſpirit being wanting, though there be a great corruption of doctrine, yet can it not be diſcerned. Another ground is, becauſe, being written in one tongue, we are forced to learn it in another tongue, into which it is not very aptly tranſlated. And although a man ſhould give himſelf to ſtudy the Hebrew and Greek; yet ſeeing they are not now uſed by any Nation, but have their Being onely in Books, he will never be able to lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n them ſo perfectly, but that the proper ſignification and various uſe of many words and phraſes, will be hid from his knowledg. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, this obſcurity we ſpeak of, is not ſo great, but that where ſome portion of the Spirit is preſent, thoſe things at leaſt which are neceſſary to be known for ſalvation, may eaſily be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. And ſo much for the cauſes of not diſcerning a change in doctrine, which are in the doctrine it ſelf; we are now to handle ſuch Cauſes as are in the maner of the change.</p>
            <pb n="117" facs="tcp:150539:69"/>
            <p>Now the manner of the change makes it undiſcerned, for as much as the change is made by little and little, for, if ſo be, as we ſaid before, out of ſome great heap of grain, every day ſome few grains ſhould be taken, and as many of another ſort be put in the room of them, who could be able to diſcover the mutation? Who is able to diſcern how much it is that a boy grows daily, or how much a man declines and waxes old? Now the very ſelf-ſame thing is to be ſeen in the mutation of doctrine: for we ſhall have a man, to day ſuppoſe, who if he make no other change, will at leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſome generall name, for to call ſuch things by, as agree in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or in ſome common reference or reſpect: which name will be afterward applied to things very different, and it ſhal by this means come to paſſe, that the nature and notion of the former things will be obſcured: thus did they that firſt called the holy waſhing, and the Supper of our Lord, <hi>Sacraments.</hi> What hurt could any one ſo much as ſuſpect from ſo ſmall a matter? Howbeit, in proceſs of time, there were thoſe, who ſuppoſing that any ſacred and holy rite was intended by the terme <hi>Sacrament,</hi> began to give that name to laying on of hands, Marriage, Penitence, Confirmation, Extreme Unction: Whence it is come to paſſe, that Baptiſme, and the Supper, having a name common to them, with other things of much different nature; their true notion is rendred, dark and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure. For there remained with the generall name, a notion in like manner generall and common to thoſe other things: whereas, the proper notion, which ought ever to be kept in mind, is forgotten. Hence alſo it came to paſs, that as it was manifeſt, that baptiſm and the Supper were ordained by our Lord: So was it commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that all thoſe other things termed Sacraments, were in like maner by him inſtituted. At length Bels began to be baptiſed: which practiſe, what elſe did it, but occaſion the ſimple peopl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to think, that the baptiſme of men was of the ſame importance with that baptiſme they ſaw practiſed upon the Bels; whereby, the memory of the waſhing away of ſins by the blood of Chriſt, ſignified by the waſhing with water, was aboliſhed? Now, this makes much to hide the couſenage and deceit, when there is a colourable pretence: So as the innovators may ſeem not to bring in any new thing; but to deſire the preſervation of doctrines, received by ſome weak ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony and obſervation. Wherefore, when the firſt Chriſtians, or
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:150539:70"/> rather thoſe which ſucceeded the firſt, growing very remiſs, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their former heat of piety (which is commonly ſeen when men ceaſe to be exerciſed by afflictions) and ſo growing leſs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in the exerciſe of breaking of bread: ſome one peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there was who judged it a very good courſe, that the Prieſt at leaſt, ſhould frequently receive the bread and wine in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the multitude: and by ſo doing, celebrate the memory of the Lords death: for as much as it would be all one in a manner, as if the by-ſtanders had all of them communicated and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated thereof. In which practiſe, truly a man would not think there was any innovation, but only a care ſhewed to preſerve ſo whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome an ordinance of our Lord from growing quite out of uſe, which being grown into a cuſtom; foraſmuch as it was done wholly to commemorate that ſacrifice which our Lord offered for us upon the Croſs, and the term of Prieſt was not wanting, it gave occaſion to ſome, to attribute the name of the thing ſignified to the thing ſignifying, ſo as to call this performance now no longer the commemoration of a ſacrifice, but a ſacrifice it ſelf. Afterward, when it had obtained the name of ſacrifice, who will wonder that it began to be accounted a ſacrifice? And ſo whiles every day there was innovation made, yet inaſmuch as it was little which was changed, and ſome very goodly pretext was ever in readineſs, the innovation could not be perceived; ſo that at length, the moſt plain and ſimple inſtitution of our Lord, concerning breaking of bread, was by a wonderful metamorphoſis changed into that moſt pompous and laborious buſineſs of the Maſs. And who ſo ſhall diligently conſider, will eaſily obſerve that the like hath happened touching all other points. In thoſe that are the Teachers, in caſe they corrupt any point, the main cauſe why ſuch their corruption is not diſcerned, is the great opinion which men have of their piety, holineſs, and learning, and their being thought to ſtand very much affected to the doctrine received. Now ſuch an opinion as this with the people, a man attains, either by giving ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent proof of himſelf, or by the teſtimony of ſuch men as are of greateſt repute, or by right, as it were, of inheritance. He gives a good proof of himſelf, who does acutely and fluently diſcourſe of matters divine, and by often citing the Scriptures, and to good purpoſe, ſhews himſelf well verſed in ſuch ſtudies: but eſpecially,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:150539:70"/> if he ſhew himſelf an eager oppoſer of ſuch doctrines as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple abhor, and a great honorer and reverencer of ſuch perſons, as the people highly account of: Now the teſtimonies of men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved beget a good opinion in the people, becauſe men are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, That in regard of their gravity and prudence, they will wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs nothing, but that wherof they have a certain knowledg, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as notwithſtanding it is very often ſeen, that by ſimulation, flattery, and other arts, the over-great facility of good men is ſo overcome, and wrought upon, as that they may be brought to commend ſuch perſons, of whoſe piety and learning they have ſmall knowledg. In the mean time, however their teſtimonies are drawn from them, yet the ſimple common people do yeeld thereunto no leſs credit, then if they were oracles. Some men gain a good opinion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as it were by right of inheritance, when as they ſucceed in place, ſuch perſons whoſe life and doctrine have been very much approved of. For it ſeems a likely thing, That none but good men ſhould be put into the place of good men, and ſo the reputation of honeſty and learning is transfered from the one to the other, even as inheritances paſs from the Father to the children. Nevertheleſs, even as thoſe who from a low and mean eſtate, have by great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors and difficulties attained great wealth, leave their children, heirs of thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> goods indeed, and all their poſſeſſions, but not of their induſtry and wit; foraſmuch, as being born in the midſt of wealth, they finde no need to exerciſe their wit: even ſo thoſe men who are at certain ſeaſons, ſtired up by the providence of God to purge the Church from errors, ſince they cannot but be exerciſed with great and knotty difficulties, they muſt be of neceſſity armed with very excellent vertues, and ſo become famous; whereas their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, matters being reduced into order and compoſed, and Satan dealing now no longer by force, but by craft and policy (which they are not aware of) they meet with no conſiderable occaſions to exerciſe their piety and prudence. Yet nevertheleſs, though they be far inferior in vertue, yet in outward appearance, as they hold the place of their predeceſſors, ſo do they retain their dignity and reputation: and by how much the farther you deſcend from thoſe firſt, ſo much the more unlike ſhall you finde their ſucceſſors, and the more eſtranged from their vertues. And foraſmuch as the ſame or greater authority abides, with very little piety, prudence, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:150539:71"/> and hearty diligence; who ſees not, how eaſily it may come to paſs, That they may daily, through unskilfulneſs, corrupt many points, and no man diſcern the ſame by reaſon of their authority and reputation? And to the end, that ſuch like Paſtors may by little and little be brought into place, by whoſe means, Satan hopes to procure a greater and ſpeedier corruption of doctrine; it is a great furtherance, if ſo be ſuch things ſhall be annexed to Eccleſiaſtical Functions, as ſhall make them much to be deſired: as for Paſtors to be highly eſteemed of, to have all men riſe unto them, and give them place; if they ſhall be well accommodated and live in abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of wealth; if they ſhall be accounted ſuch as ought to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure all, and themſelves not to be queſtioned, without impiety and wickedneſs. For who is there that would not exceedingly deſire to be in ſuch a condition? So that in caſe there be theſe allurements and the like, as ſoon as any place ſhall be vacant, take heed of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſome excellent perſon ſhall obtain the ſame: he will ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt obtain it, that does beſt know how to beat the buſh that can ſue for it with greateſt art. A good and godly man, though he conceive he may honeſtly ſeek it, as minding onely the glory of God, and not his own honor or profit; yet for this cauſe he will not ſue for it, foraſmuch as thoſe that are truly pious, being moſt of all conſcious of their own weakneſs, which is always great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, have a modeſt opinion of themſelves, and account them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves inferior almoſt to every one. And if ſo be the times prove yet ſo good, as that offices are beſtowed, not upon thoſe that hunt after them, but upon choice and qualified perſons: yet ſhall not the beſt men, even at ſuch a time, always meet with beſt quarter. Inaſmuch as men void of all craft, and enemies to all bad arts, taking more pains to be good indeed, then to ſeem to be ſo, are eaſily in the gaining of an eſtimation of holineſs, out-ſtriped by crafty fellows, ambitious of honor and dignity. For they will not ſo cuningly hide their own infirmities, they will take more pains to be rid of, then to hide their vices, they will not uſe any policies to procure the favor of men. He that is ambitious of honor, will moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully hide all his vices: he will moſt diligently addict himſelf to whatſoever he underſtands thoſe men do moſt approve of who are able to promote him; and will never leave until, by ſimulation, diſſimulation and flattery, he have gained their approbation to the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:150539:71"/> full. And by this hidden and more cunning and painful kinde of ſuing, ſometimes wicked perſons prevail as much, as they could do, were they allowed to uſe an open and free trade.</p>
            <p>It remains, that we ſpeak of ſuch cauſes of the not perceiving, that a change of doctrine is introduced, as conſiſt in the perſons that are taught. Now they are chiefly two, careleſneſs and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Careleſneſs for the moſt part ariſeth hence, In that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple truſt too much to their Paſtors; and perſwade themſelves, that they will not ſlip into any error, and that therefore they have ſmall need to have an eye over them, but that they are bound rather to embrace whatſoever they ſhall hold forth, without any curious examination. Hereunto may be added many other buſineſſes, whereunto men addict themſelves: For that ſaying is of large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, <hi>Where mens treaſure is, there is their heart,</hi> and that other, <hi>No man can ſerve two maſters.</hi> Now, how it may come to paſs that after a people hath once had a great knowledg of divine Truths, the ſaid knowledg may as it were vaniſh away, beſides that cauſe which hath been even now alleadged, we ſhall in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place make diſcovery of ſome other reaſons. We ſhall for the preſent adde onely this one; That the people themſelves are in a perpetual kinde of mutation, ſome daily dying and departing, others ſucceeding and growing up in their ſtead. Whence it comes to paſs, That ſince the change which is made in every age, is ſmall, either the people cannot perceive it; or if they do obſerve it, yet they eſteem it not of ſuch moment, as to think fit to move any difference thereabout. This thing alſo is of very great force, to keep the people from taking notice of a change in doctrine; when men ſhall perſwade themſelves, that they are not able to judg of matters of Religion, as though <hi>it is, it is not,</hi> and other words uſed in Scripture, do not ſignifie the ſame which they do in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſcourſe, or as if nothing could be underſtood, without ſome great knowledg in the Tongues and Arts or Sciences, and as if the power of the Spirit were of no efficacy without theſe helps. Whereby it comes to paſs, that whiles they think they underſtand not even thoſe things which in ſome ſort they do underſtand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expreſſed in moſt clear and evident words; they do at length arrive to that blockiſhneſs, that they cannot underſtand them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; ſo that, though they have before their eyes a ſentence of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:150539:72"/> ſo clear, that nothing can be more evident; yet if they to whoſe authority they in all things ſubject themſelves, ſhall ſay any thing point-blank oppoſite thereunto, they will give credit unto them, and imagine themſelves not to ſee that which they ſee as clear as the light. And by theſe means verily it comes to paſs, That when the doctrine of Religion is corrupted, the mutation is not diſcovered: Furthermore, when the doctrine is once begun to be changed, it muſt needs be, that out of one error another ſhould ſpring, and propagate infinitely; and God, for juſt reaſons of his own, blinding them, men bring upon themſelves ſo great darkneſs, and ſlip into ſuch foul errors; That if God out of mercy open a mans eyes, and let him ſee thoſe errors he lives in, he can ſcarcely believe himſelf, or be perſwaded that he was ever enveloped with ſuch blinde errors. Which thing is as true, and as well to be ſeen in men of greateſt learning and experience. If thou ſhalt thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peruſe the writings of ſome of the Schoolmen (as they call them) thou ſhalt in ſome places meet with ſo much acuteneſs, as will make thee admire. Thou ſhalt ſee them oftentimes cleave a fine thred into many parts, and accurately anatomiſe a flea, and a little after fall ſo foully, and avouch ſuch abſurdities, That thou canſt not ſufficiently ſtand amazed; wherefore we muſt obey that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Poet.</p>

            </q>
            <p>Now there is need of a double Caution: <hi>viz.</hi> That there be no change made in the doctrine, when it is pure: And if any change be made, that there be notice taken of it. Now look what change is made in this kinde, all the blame is laid upon thoſe whoſe office it is to inſtruct the people; for though themſelves are the authors of the change, yet will the people impute it to the Miniſters ſleepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and want of care at leaſt. It concerns therefore the Paſtors and Teachers to be Eagle-eyed, and to be very well acquainted with thoſe cauſes, whereby the change of doctrine becomes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcovered, and to have them at their fingers ends, and to be wary, that on no hand they may miſcarry. Now it will be an excellent
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:150539:72"/> caution for the keeping of doctrine pure, if they ſhall avoid all curious and vain controverſies: If they ſhall ſet before their eyes, the ſcope and end of all religious doctrine, and likewiſe a ſeries or catalogue of all ſuch things, as make to the attainment of that end (of which we formerly ſpake;) if they ſhall affect not onely the matter it ſelf, but alſo the words and phraſes which the holy Ghoſt in Scripture makes uſe of, and exceedingly ſuſpect all differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent forms of ſpeaking. Not that I would have them to ſpeak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Hebraiſms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ſo their language would not be plain nor intelligible; but I wiſh that they will ſhun all ſuch expreſſions, as have been invented by over-nice diſputants, beyond what was neceſſary to expreſs the ſence of the Hebrew and Greek, and all thoſe tenets which men by their own wits do collect and infer from the Scriptures. Now of what concernment this will be, we may gather by this inſtance: The Papiſts think it one and the ſame thing to ſay, <hi>The Church cannot erre;</hi> and to ſay in the words of our Lord, <hi>Whereſoever two or three ſhall be gathered together in my name, there will I be in the midſt of them.</hi> Yet is the difference very great, which may thus appear; foraſmuch as in caſe any one ſhall conceive the Church to be the Pope, Cardinals, and Biſhops anointed by the Pope: he hearing the aforeſaid ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, will judg, that whatſoever they ſhall decree, ought to be of force. But if he ſhall rather minde the words of our Lord, and ſhall conſider that thoſe kinde of men, do regard nothing but their own commodity, wealth and dominion; he will be ſo far from ſo underſtanding them, that peradventure not being able to allow the deeds and practiſes of theſe men, he will come to hope from thoſe words, That if himſelf with ſome other good men loving God with their whole heart, ſhall come together, and unanimouſly implore the aſſiſtance of God, ſhall be better able to determine what it is that ought to be believed and practiſed for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſalvation, then if they ſhould perſiſt to put their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in ſuch Paſtors. Now this rule, That the words of the Scripture ought to be uſed rather then any other, is then eſpecially to be obſerved, when any thing is delivered as a certain and tryed truth, or as a rule of faith or life, or out of which any other thing is to be inferred. For in expoſitions and explanations, as there is need haply of greater liberty, ſo is there leſs danger if it be taken.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:150539:73"/> For, when as the word of God, and the expoſition thereof, are at one and the ſame time both together in view, as it were; there no man can be ignorant, that the expoſition is the word of man, ſo that he may reject it, in caſe it ſeem impertinent. And look by what means a man may hinder the doctrine of Religion from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing changed, by the ſelf ſame he may finde whether it be changed or no. Now every man ought to compare the doctrine of that age wherein he lives, with no other doctrine then that which was out of queſtion ſpotleſs, which is the doctrine of the Apoſtles. Wherefore, notwithſtanding that in our age the Goſpel is as it were revived, yet ought not any man thus to think, That he ought to examine whether the Goſpel hath loſt any of that purity wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto it had at this time arrived; he ought rather to look again and again, whether ſome corruption do not yet remain, whether it be not in ſome part, as yet not ſufficiently reſtored to its ancient pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and luſtre: and confidently perſwade himſelf, That he cannot be (that I may ſo ſpeak) ſufficiently ſuperſtitious, in rejecting every word which is not in the Scriptures. Foraſmuch as man will ever be more wiſe and wary then the holy Spirit, and can very hardly forbear to mingle ſomewhat from his own head: ſo that whatever comes from man, can never be ſufficiently ſuſpected. And becauſe a thing will be ſo much the better preſerved, by how much the greater is the number of thoſe that keep it: the people ought often to be put in minde, That both the reading of the Scriptures, and the care of Religion, belongs not to the Paſtors of the Church onely; but that every one that would be ſaved ought to make diligent ſearch, whether any corruption be already, or is for the future like to be introduced; and this to do no leſs carefully, then if he were perſwaded that all beſide himſelf were aſleep: and whatſoever is wont to take the common people off from ſuch ſtudies, care muſt be taken that that thing be wholly taken away. Concerning which matter, we ſhall more conveniently diſcourſe anon.</p>
            <p>Now, foraſmuch as the profit will be ſmall, if ſome private man ſhall obſerve that an error is introduced, unleſs he diſcover the ſaid error, and lay it open: there muſt of neceſſity be ſome way how this may conveniently be done. Now there cannot be a more fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way, then that which Apoſtle propounds to the <hi>Corinthians.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:150539:73" rendition="simple:additions"/> Let two or three Prophets ſpeak, and let the reſt judg;</hi>

               <hi>and if any thing be revealed to him that ſits by, let the former be ſilent. For ye may all prophecy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted.</hi> If ſome one perſon ſhall always ſpeak in the Church, and no man at any time may contradict him; it will be a very ſtrange thing, if that one man be not puffed up, if he do not fall into ſuch a conceit of himſelf, as to think that he is the onely man, that he onely hath underſtanding, he alone is wiſe: that all the reſt are a company of brute animals as it were, who ought to depend onely upon him, and to do nothing but learn of him. And if any man ſhall think, that himſelf likewiſe hath ſome ability to teach, he will account that man an hainous offender. But what ſays the Apoſtle to this? <hi>Did the word of God come from you? or came it unto you onely? If any ſeem to be a prophet, or ſpiritual; let him acknowledg what I write unto you to be the commands of the Lord. But if any one be ignorant, let him be ignorant. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore brethren, labor that ye may prophecy, and forbid not to ſpeak with tongues, let all things be done decently, and in order.</hi> It is exceedingly to be lamented, That this cuſtom, and the practice of this command of the Lord, is not again reſtored into the Churches, and brought into uſe. But ſome men may ſay; Such is the raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this age of ours, ſuch the boldneſs, ſuch the impudence, That if it were allowed to every one to ſpeak in the Congregation, there will be no end of brawls and contention. Why ſo? Is a man another kinde of creature now, then what he was of old? Thou wilt ſay, he is. For mankinde hath continually degenerated, grown worſe and worſe, and ſeems now to have attained the top of corruption. Is it ſo indeed? But, ſuppoſe it to be ſo. Thou that art the Teacher of the people, art not thou alſo thy ſelf made of the ſame mold? Art not thou born in the ſame age? Inaſmuch as this ordinance principally was intended to keep Paſtors within the bounds of modeſty: that they may underſtand, That they are not the authors of the Word of God, that they have not alone received the Spirit: by how much the more mankinde hath degenerated, by ſo much the greater need is there thereof; for, that there is now, more raſhneſs, arrogance, pride, then of old; this is true, as well of the Paſtors and Teachers, as of the reſt of the people. Art thou a Prophet, haſt thou any portion of the Spirit? If thou haſt not,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:150539:74"/> ſo unfiting it is, that thou alone ſhouldeſt ſpeak in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, that there will hardly be found any that deſires rather to be ſilenc't, then thy ſelf. But if thou art a prophet, if thou haſt the Spirit, mark what the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Acknowledg</hi> (quoth he) <hi>that thoſe things which I write, are the commandments of the Lord.</hi> Go to then, On the one ſide we have the judgment of our Lord, willing that prophecy (for this is a word that we are obliged to uſe) ſhould be common to all, and that not for the deſtruction, but the ſalvation of the Church: On the other ſide, we have thy judgment, who feareſt leſt that may breed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and confuſion; whoſe iudgment now ought we rather ſtand to? If thou ſhalt conceive we muſt ſtand to thine: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what thou aſſumeſt unto thy ſelf, and what will become of thy modeſty.

Yet if thou ſhalt diligently ſearch thine heart, thou ſhalt finde there a certain diſpoſition ready to contend even with God himſelf: Which motion of thy heart, muſt by no means be hearkened unto, but ſharply repreſſed, and wholly ſubjected to the Spirit of God. It may ſeem peradventure an abſurd thing, That after ſome very learned perſon hath ſpoken, ſome contemptible perſon ſhall be allowed to contradict him. Can ſuch a perſon ſo do without great raſhneſs and temerity? Were I to ſpeak according to the judgment of man, verily I could not deny it. But if we be really perſwaded, That the knowledg of matters divine, ought not to be attributed to our watching, ſtudies, wits, but to God and to his Spirit, wherewith he can in a moment endue the ſimpleſt perſon in the world, and that with no more
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:150539:74" rendition="simple:additions"/> labor or difficulty, then if he were to give him unto one that had ſpent <hi>Neſtors</hi> age in ſtudy: What reaſon is there for me to judg that this man does raſhly and unadviſedly, if he ſhall ariſe and contradict? Is not the ſpirit able to reveal ſomewhat to him, which he hath hidden from thee? Now, if the ſpirit have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed ſomewhat to him, and to that end revealed it that he might contradict, that by his means the thing may be revealed to the Church: ſhall I ſay that he hath done raſhly in obeying the holy Ghoſt? And if thou think otherwiſe, verily thou art not perſwaded that the Spirit is the Author and Teacher of this Knowledg, but that all the praiſe thereof is due to ſtudies, watchings, and the wits of men. And if this be thy judgment, I tell thee again, That thou art not onely unworthy to be the ſole ſpeaker, but worthy rather to be the onely perſon not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſpeak in the congregation. And that thou mayſt the better underſtand, that the moſt unlearned ought to be allowed to ſpeak, conſider, God will have himſelf to be acknowledged the Author of his own gifts: he will not have his praiſe attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted unto our ſtudies or wits, but unto himſelf. But if the man that hath ſpent all his life in ſtudy, ſpeak wiſely, it is not attributed to God, but to ſtudy: In word perhaps it may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to God, yet not without a vehement reluctancy of our judgment: and this is that which (I ſay) God will not abide. But if ſo be thou ſhalt hear a wiſe word come out of the mouth of ſome unlearned perſon, thou muſt needs, whether thou wilt or no, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

For if the people ſhall ſee now one man, now another, endued with the ſpirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all expectation; many will thereby be encouraged to hope
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:150539:75"/> for the ſame gift, if they ſhall ask it; many will learn and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; and it will thereby come to paſs, that when occaſion ſhall be to chooſe a Miniſter, the Church ſhall not need to call ſtrange and unknown perſons to that office, but ſhe may have of her own ſuch as are fit to be choſen, men whoſe converſation and manners are ſufficiently known. And when the number of ſuch as are able to prophecy, ſhall be great, the Church will not be forced to uſe ſuch Paſtors as from their very childhood have propoſed to themſelves ſuch offices as the reward of their ſtudies; and addicted themſelves to the ſtudy of Scripture and Religion, no otherwiſe then they would have done to ſome Trade, whereby they meant in time to get their living: So that a man can expect but very few of them to prove other then mercenary or hireling Paſtors.

               </gap>hat it was the cuſtom of the Jewiſh Church, that all might thus prophecy; we may hence conjecture, in that it is upon Record, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Luke 4.</note> how our Lord, <hi>upon the Sabbath day according to the cuſtom, came into the Synagogue, took a book and expounded a place of Eſay;</hi> and how, <hi>being twelve yeers of age he ſate at Jeruſalem in the temple among the Doctors, and did diſpute.</hi> For he could not ſo do by vertue of any ordinary office, foraſmuch as his age was uncapable, neither did the Doctors know who he was. Yea rather, our Lord in ſo doing muſt needs make uſe of the power which was granted to every one to ſpeak.

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:150539:75" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Church: And all was done with love, in ſuch ſort, That they ſtrove mutually to honor each other, and every one to prefer an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other before himſelf. But to the end this common propheſying may be profitable to the Church, we muſt diligently mark what the Apoſtle adviſes. For a ſure thing it is, that the pride of man is ſo great, that whatever hath once fallen from him, he will by any means have it ſtand for a Truth, neither can he ſuffer that any man ſhould infringe the ſame. So that if he might be p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rmitted to judg, that laſt ſpake, it will be a miracle, if a man in his life-time ſhould ſee any one give way to him that contradicts him: What is <hi>Pauls</hi> advice therefore in this caſe? <hi>Let two or three Prophets ſpeak, and let the reſt judge.</hi> He will not therefore have the ſame perſons to be parties and judges. And he adds a little after, <hi>And the ſpirit of the Prophets is ſubject to the Prophets, for God is not the Author of diſſention, but of peace.</hi> So that as ſoon as any man hath ſpoken his own mind, he ought to reſt himſelf ſatisfied with the judgment of the reſt, and not obſtinately to make no end of contending: if this be not done, a ſure thing it is, there will be no end of ſtrife. But what if any man will not be content to ſubmit to the judgment of the reſt: Verily I would avouch, that being ſharply admoniſhed, that he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb not the Congregation, and that he go not againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Apoſtle, or rather of our Lord, commanding the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Prophets to be ſubject to the Prophets; he ought to be caſt out of the ſociety, though he ſhould hold the prime place in the Congregation. The people likewiſe muſt frequently be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; that liberty for any one to ſpeak in the Congregation, is not therefore granted by the Apoſtle, to the end every one ſhould ſpeak what comes to his tongues end, as if he were in a market; but whereas he gives liberty to him to ſpeak to whom any thing is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, he would have all raſhneſſe and impudence to be laid aſide. He that reverences not the Church of God, let that man know, he deſpiſeth the Spirit of God, who is Preſident there; and ſhall be ſure not to eſcape unpuniſhed. Before a man propounds any thing to the Church, he ought to conſider again and again, how ſure a manifeſtation he hath of that thing, and what ever the matter be, let him be ſure not to forget a ſober, modeſt, baſhful behavior,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:150539:76"/> without which vertues, doubtles no good can be effected. But here we muſt attentively conſider, both how far a man ought to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the judgement of the Congregation, and who may deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly be accounted a troubler of the Church. Verily, I conceive a man ought ſo far to give way, as that after I have alledged what I had to ſay for my opinion, if yet the reſt ſhall not allow of my judgment, I ought to give over defending of it, and ceaſe to be troubleſome to the Congregation concerning the ſame: But I ought not to be compelled to confeſſe that I have erred, or to deprecate any fault, whiles I do not yet underſtand that I have erred, for ſo I ſhould ſinne againſt God. He therefore is a troubler of the Church, that will not, ſo far as we have expreſſed, ſubmit to the judgment of the Church, but goeth on to be troubleſome; but eſpecially that man who would exact of another that which he ought not to do; <hi>viz.</hi> to recant, being not perſwaded that he is in an error. But thoſe men are commonly reputed troublers of the Church, who refuſe to ratifie what ever ſhall any wayes fall out of the Paſtors mouths. Again, in this place it may reaſonably be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, whether, when that a matter hath been once or twice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, and ſome man knowing the judgment of the Congregation, would again reduce it into Controverſie, he ought to be heard, or enjoyned ſilence, and take the matter for determined. But of this we ſhall in another place more conveniently diſpute. That which remains, therefore, is, that we wraſtle with God, by daily prayers, to grant that we may have the uſe of this ſo ſoveraign and ſaving liberty, ſo profitable to the Church, and that thereby we may reap aboundance of fruit. And that he would, to that end, tame and break our ſpirits with his Spirit, and render them milde and gentle: and not ſuffer what he hath ordained for the confirmation and eſtabliſhment of his Church, to be by the ſtubbornneſſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs of our wits and minds, turned to the miſchief and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction thereof. Now it hath been frequently practiſed, that when ſome difficult point hath been to be decided, not only one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church ſhould judge, but a Councell of that Province, or of the whole Chriſtian world hath been called. Which, whether it ought to be done or no, and what ought to be the Authority of Councels, may be by ſome demanded. That the cuſtom of calling
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:150539:76" rendition="simple:additions"/> Councels ought to be retained, ſeems clearly to me, to be taught by the example of the Apoſtles. For, if it were requiſite for men endued with ſo great a meaſure of the Spirit, to confer together about matters of Religion in controverſie: It ſeems, that it ought much more to be practiſed by thoſe that have not ſuch a portion of the ſpirit: Neither ought we to make light account of our Lords promiſe, who hath engaged himſelf, that where two or three ſhall be gathered together in his Name, there he will be the in midſt of them. But the queſtion moved concerning the authority of ſuch a Councell, is harder. And for as much as I have not now to deale with Papiſts, but with ſuch as would have the truth of the Goſpel reſtored; I ſhall not need with many words to demonſtrate, that no Councel hath authority either to make new Lawes, or to ordain new worſhips. But what ſhall we ſay concerning controverſies of Religion, which are raiſed about interpretation of Scripture? Whether or no, hath a Councel authority, in ſuch caſes, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what ought to be held? And if a Councel cannot do thus much at leaſt, what other uſe there can be of Councels beſide? And whether there be any difference between the Councel of the Apoſtles, and thoſe of their ſucceſſors? If, as certain as it is that our Lord will always perform what he hath promiſed, ſo certain it were that ſuch as meet to conſult, would evermore refer all their cogitations to the glory of God, and place all their hope of diſcovering the Truth in the promiſes of our Lord, and the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Spirit: there were no reaſon, but that all the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Councels ſhould be accounted firm and authentick. But foraſmuch as theſe are the ſecrets of mens mindes and hearts, God onely can know them. And inaſmuch as theſe conditions which are annexed to our Lords promiſe, are hidden, the conſcience, in this caſe, hath nothing certain to reſt upon. Make it appear to me, that a company, either of Biſhops, or any other men, are met together in the name of Chriſt; I ſhall willingly ſtand to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations; but how wilt thou make it appear, that they are ſo met? Becauſe themſelves profeſs ſo much; as if a company of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly diſſemblers would not ſay as much concerning themſelves. Doubtleſs it is no ways likely, that God hath impoſed ſuch a law upon us; as one time or another, whether we do obey it, or not
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:150539:77"/> obey it, will render us guilty. But ſuch a law were impoſed upon us, in caſe we were bound to obey a Councel, and in the mean time, either the Councel may erre, or in caſe it do erre, our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhall not finde excuſe before God. But, that Councels may erre we doubt not; yea verily, nothing is more ſure, then that Councels have often erred. And if we ſhall give obedience to the impious determination of a Councel, ſure we are, that no Text of Scripture will excuſe us: yea rather, we are ſtrictly admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to give credit ſo much as to an Angel from Heaven, if he would teach us any thing beſides what hath been delivered by the Apoſtles. For the holy Scriptures are ſet before us, out of which we are to know the will of God: Which that we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, we are taught to pray to God for wiſdom, and the holy Ghoſt; that we ſhould reſt in the determinations of Councels, there is not a word, that I know, in Scripture, to warrant us. Now, if ſo be our obedience to Councels, in caſe they determine any thing amiſs, ſhall not be excuſed: neither have we any aſſurance that Councels never erre: Neither may it be ſaid, that God hath ſubjected us unto ſuch a law, whereunto one time or another we can neither obey, nor not obey without ſin: It follows, that none ought to be compelled to ſtand to the determinations of Councels. Now ſince it is all one to ſay, that a Councel hath authority to judg of controverſies of Religion, or to ſay, that every man ought to obey whatever a Councel ſhall decree; and ſince we have ſhewed that there is no Law binding men to give ſuch obedience, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, That a Councel hath no ſuch authority to judg in matters of Religion. It may further be demanded, what we ſay concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him who is called to the office of a Teacher? whether he ought wholly to obey a Councel, ſo as to teach nothing different from the Councels determinations? It were an abſurd thing doubtleſs, for a man to be bound to teach that unto others, which he himſelf cannot ſafely believe: or ſhall he be more excuſed, if he follow the impious determination of a Councel in his teaching, then if he himſelf for his own particular, embrace and believe the ſame? Yea verily much leſs, for <hi>Paul</hi> will have him to be accurſed who ſhall teach any thing beſide what the Apoſtles have taught; or is he rather then the man that onely believes the Councel, but
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:150539:77"/> teaches not, entangled in this gin or trap, That whether he obey or obey not, he muſt offend? or ſhall he rather keep himſelf ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent? <hi>Wo is me</hi> (ſays <hi>Paul) if I ſhall not teach the Goſpel;</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, <hi>We ought rather to obey God then men.</hi> It is manifeſt therefore, That a Councel hath not authority ſo to judg of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, as that men ſhould be bound to obey their decrees. Inaſmuch therefore as Councels are to be called indeed, but not to this end, of neceſſity there muſt be ſome other end why they are to be called. If ſo be therefore Councels ſhall meet, that the controverſies which trouble the Church being propounded, and every one having free liberty to ſpeak, thoſe to whom the Lord ſhall pleaſe to reveal any thing to the clearing of matters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, may ſpeak and declare their judgment; and the reſt afterwards judg; not ſo, as to vote, and the greater part to make a Law to neceſſitate every man to aſſent (for ſo the greater part would commonly be too hard for the better) but that every one might weigh what is ſaid; to the end, That if he ſhall finde it proved by ſufficient teſtimonies of Scripture, he may both em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it himſelf, and endevor to perſwade others to embrace the ſame; not by urging the authority of the Councel, but by thoſe Texts of Scripture which he heard alleadged in the Councel. Doubtleſs if thoſe that meet together ſhould make this their aym, although amongſt two or three hundred hypocrites there ſhould not be above three or four perſons truly pious, who heartily ſeek the glory of God, and put their confidence in the promiſes which our Lord hath made, praying to him that he would reveal the truth unto them; they, as few as they be, ſhould not meet in vain, doubtleſs that ſo great number of hypocrites, ſhould not cauſe our Lords promiſes to become vain and of no force. What ſhould be revealed to one, that would all that were docible imbrace; and ſo Satan ſhould in vain, hope to get the victory by the number and multitude of perſons unskilful, and of his masked and diſguiſed ſubjects, or by the outward, dignity of mens perſons. There would not then be ſuch a ſtir to purchaſe voices and to make up the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſufficient to carry the matter: but the care would be rather, how every man might finde ſuch ground of Truth, as upon which he might ſafely rely. Verily, we ſhould often ſee, that even by the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:150539:78"/> meaneſt and moſt contemptible of the company, God would diſpel great miſts of errors. But ſo long as moſt account ſhall be made of number, and the gliſtering of outward dignity; ſo long as the conſent of the major part ſhall ſtand for a law, nothing is more ſure, then that Satan ſhall ordinarily get the victory and bear away the bel in ſuch Councels. Which way, then, wilt thou ſay, may a man be excluded the communion of the godly, becauſe of ſome ungodly tenet which he ſhall hold? Shall the authority of any particular Church be greater then the authority of the whole or univerſal Church: ſo as that the particular may condemn both the tenet and the man, and general or Catholike Church may not? I anſwer: A particular Church condemning any man, unleſs their condemnation be juſt, they do indeed ſeparate that man from themſelves, ſo far forth, as that they do not acknowledg him to be one of them, but they ſeparate him not from Chriſt: Neither do they pronounce him faulty before God, becauſe he would not credit them to believe as they did: How juſtly they reject him, let them look to it. But when the Congregation juſtly rejects, it does not therefore juſtly reject, becauſe the man will not embrace its tenets, or ſtand to its judgment: But becauſe he rejects the doctrine which came from God, and that doctrine of ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, That it ought of neceſſity to be known to ſalvation. Likewiſe when a particular Congregation, allowes of one tenet, diſallowes of another, it does not impoſe a law upon any mans belief, but onely declares its own faith: to the end, That he which is not of the ſame minde, at leaſt in the more principal points of doctrine, may know that he belongs not to that ſociety; for there muſt of neceſſity be ſome kinde of Government, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation may not be forced to communicate in Religious Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, with that man, of whom ſhe is perſwaded that he is not any ways related to the Church of Chriſt, neither hath any right to the priviledges thereof. Hence we may eaſily underſtand, and in one word expreſs what difference there is between the Councel of the Apoſtles, and thoſe who make themſelves their ſucceſſors, be they who they will. Foraſmuch as it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that the Apoſtles were by name choſen by our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to the office of Apoſtleſhip, it was manifeſt that they were
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:150539:78"/> endued with a large meaſure of the holy Ghoſt, which Spirit would lead them into all truth: Now there is no teſtimony of any ſuch, concerning any of their ſucceſſors: We are left onely to conjecture what they are by their words and actions, which are ſubject to counterfeiting and fraud: In the Councels of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, men were not to minde, ſo much, what was judged and determined, as by whom, it was ſo determined: So that they needed not with many words to render a reaſon why they ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. Contrariwiſe in the Councels of their ſucceſſors, it matters not ſo much who they are that decree a thing, as what that thing is which they ſo decree, what teſtimonies they produce from Scripture, how clearly and manifeſtly thoſe teſtimonies do teach the point determined. So, that doctrine of <hi>Luther, That we are ſaved onely by the merits of Chriſt,</hi> is embraced by us: yet do not we look upon <hi>Luther,</hi> but upon thoſe teſtimonies which are by him cited from Scripture, which alſo the holy Ghoſt, that internal Expoſitor, witneſſes to our ſpirits, that they teach the ſame. Otherwiſe, be they never ſo many, let them be pious, learned, holy, yea verily, let them be angels of heaven, unleſs thou ſhalt perceive that what they affirm is proved by the Word of God; there is no reaſon for thee to ſuffer thine eyes to be dazled with the ſplendor and pomp of a Councel. Howbeit, fitting it is to attribute ſo much authority to a Councel (unleſs it be of ſuch as are manifeſtly enemies to truth) as not raſhly to reject the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof; but let every man diligently weigh the ſame, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring earneſtly the aſſiſtance of God, that he may judge aright. Hence likewiſe we may conjecture, who ought to be admitted to a Councel. For, ſince they do not meet to make any laws of Faith, but rather to pray for the holy Ghoſt, by whom they may be led into all truth, and in a word, to learn: It will not be neceſſary, that he that muſt be admitted, ſhould be a Biſhop, or an Archbiſhop, or a Pope, nor yet that he ſhould be famous for learning; nay rather, no reaſon there is why any man ſhould be excluded, that appears to be poſſeſſed of any meaſure of piety, and of the holy Ghoſt. So, we ſee in that ſame decree of the Apoſtolical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, after the Apoſtles and Elders, the whole Church is named. For, inaſmuch as the holy Ghoſt is not tied to any dignity, or to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:150539:79"/> any certain kinde of perſons. Who knows by whom God will chuſe to diſcover the Truth? And foraſmuch as we are not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard any number of voices, but onely what that is which is ſaid; although ſome fooliſh indiſcreet perſon, or a man that makes one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſhew of godlineſs ſhall be admitted, they cannot do much hurt; for we muſt count every man to be ſuch as his ſpeech ſhall declare him to be. And thus we have declared, by what means the doctrine of Religion comes to be corrupted; and what cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we are to uſe, when it is pure, to keep it ſo.</p>
